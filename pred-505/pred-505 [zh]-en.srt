1
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,970
I'm going to drink champagne.

2
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,970
Isn't it great?

3
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,970
I'll put this in.

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,970
It looks very tasty.

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,970
It looks really good.

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,970
cheers!

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,970
Let's eat.

8
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:42,994
This is good.

9
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,994
I am going to eat now.

10
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:46,994
what is it?

11
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:48,994
Is it a gift?

12
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,994
I'm so happy.

13
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,994
Thanks.

14
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,994
chocolate?

15
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:58,994
It looks very tasty.

16
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:00,994
What's this?

17
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,994
So cute.

18
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,994
Thanks.

19
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,994
I am very happy.

20
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,994
I am so embarrassed.

21
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:11,994
I am so embarrassed.

22
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,994
I feel awkward being around ghosts.

23
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:15,994
That is not true.

24
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,994
Amazing.

25
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,994
It's very cute.

26
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,994
So cute.

27
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,994
Is it a brand?

28
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,994
I've seen it before.

29
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,994
It's a very expensive one.

30
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:29,994
did you buy it?

31
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:31,994
I received this as a gift.

32
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:33,994
I am her boyfriend.

33
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,994
I have a boyfriend.

34
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,994
I understand.

35
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,994
he treats me well.

36
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,994
He is a very expensive man.

37
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:43,994
He is a venture capitalist.

38
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,994
Venture capitalist?

39
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:49,994
Is he a company?

40
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,994
He is a company.

41
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,994
He is the president.

42
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,994
He is great.

43
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,946
cheers!

44
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:08,426
cheers!

45
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,426
This is good.

46
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,426
I'm happy with an afternoon drink.

47
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:15,426
Why drink a light bar in the afternoon?

48
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:19,426
I have something to say.

49
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,426
Oh, you brought a camera.

50
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,426
I brought it.

51
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:24,426
very heavy.

52
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:25,426
sorry.

53
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:27,426
It seems to be recording.

54
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,426
Is it a recording?

55
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,426
Is it a recording?

56
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,426
Yes.

57
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,426
I'm watered down by customers.

58
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:28,426
I hear I'm a famous influencer now.

59
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,426
I ran into this guy the other day.

60
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:33,426
look at this.

61
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:36,626
look.

62
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:41,626
It looks very tasty.

63
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:42,626
This is where?

64
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:48,626
I went from Matma to a restaurant in a luxury hotel.

65
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:51,626
I'm taking pictures all the time.

66
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,626
They have a difference.

67
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,626
It's too fancy.

68
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,626
It used to be simpler.

69
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,626
This is a port girl.

70
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:03,626
Yes.

71
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,626
I don't know because I'm fat.

72
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,626
I've been touching my phone.

73
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,626
How many likes did you get?

74
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:15,666
I have no idea.

75
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,882
130,000 people.

76
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:19,882
Did you hear it?

77
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:20,882
What?

78
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:21,882
130,000 people.

79
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,882
It's interesting.

80
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:29,882
Aika is like this now.

81
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:33,882
We talked about soap.

82
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:37,882
She hated it instantly.

83
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,882
I think that's how it is in the video.

84
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,882
look at this.

85
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,882
I met the manager.

86
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:46,882
I met the manager.

87
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,882
I recently went to a restaurant.

88
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,882
I met Eka.

89
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,882
I said I want to go there.

90
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:59,882
Do you remember the izakaya near the restaurant?

91
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,882
a bit old.

92
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,882
Did you see her face?

93
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,882
She said she didn't want to talk anymore.

94
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:10,882
let's go there.

95
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:11,882
This is a great time.

96
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:12,882
This is a great time.

97
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:18,882
Do you remember the waiting room where Aixiang was?

98
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:21,882
I decorated the waiting room.

99
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,882
There were no girls in the waiting room.

100
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,882
You are laughing at me.

101
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:31,882
I'm not kidding you.

102
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:34,882
I'm laughing at you.

103
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,882
It was fun drinking with everyone.

104
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,394
This is who I am.

105
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:48,394
I don't want to talk about the old days.

106
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:53,394
I'm still doing it.

107
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,394
I feel rejected.

108
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,394
I am very sad.

109
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:01,810
I am angry.

110
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,810
I'm a little annoyed.

111
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,810
But the world we live in is different.

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,810
what is she doing?

113
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,810
She has a young manager boyfriend.

114
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,810
She has no money.

115
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,810
She eats well and drinks well.

116
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,810
I envy her very much.

117
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,002
I am angry.

118
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,002
I'm thinking about one thing.

119
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,002
what is it?

120
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:41,098
I'm thinking about raping Aika.

121
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,354
rape?

122
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,354
I do not understand.

123
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,354
I am angry.

124
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:57,354
I'm thinking about raping Aika.

125
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:02,354
I'm terrified of making my old friend angry.

126
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,354
You want to see it too.

127
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,354
I am going to hell.

128
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,474
sorry.

129
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,474
sorry.

130
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:18,474
sorry.

131
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,474
sorry.

132
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,474
You are wonderful.

133
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,474
You look happy.

134
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,474
You look happy.

135
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,474
let's go.

136
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,438
let's go.

137
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,010
I'm going.

138
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,418
I'm back.

139
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,418
Welcome back.

140
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:47,306
what have you done?

141
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,826
You're back.

142
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,826
Congratulations.

143
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,826
What's this?

144
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,826
Congratulations.

145
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,826
I am leaving.

146
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,826
Iâ€™m waiting for you.

147
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,390
Congratulations.

148
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:11,258
Happy birthday to you

149
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:15,258
Happy birthday to you

150
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:20,258

151
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:25,258
Happy birthday to you

152
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:27,258
I did it!

153
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,258
do it again!

154
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,258
I gotta go

155
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:34,258
Congratulations! Thank you!

156
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,258
I'm so happy!

157
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:42,258
Thank you!

158
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:46,258
Aikawa, today's work must be very tiring

159
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:50,258
I'm so happy! I am very tired

160
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,258
I thought you'd be fine

161
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,258
I'm so happy!

162
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:56,258
i will do my best

163
00:08:56,258 --> 00:09:05,258
Let's do our best!

164
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,258
Let's do our best!

165
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,258
Let's do our best!

166
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:15,258
By the way, we'll be back early tomorrow

167
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:17,258
Really?

168
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:20,258
Don't drink until then!

169
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,258
i will be drunk

170
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:37,442
We used to use our bodies to make money.

171
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:42,442
But right now, I don't want to talk about that at all.

172
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,442
People change.

173
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,442
I'm afraid of rent.

174
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,442
I will be buying it soon. wait.

175
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:58,018
I will call.

176
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:01,018
I'm calling my boss.

177
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,010
Did you get the call?

178
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,010
Yes.

179
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,010
show me.

180
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,010
I'm not here.

181
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,010
This is his house.

182
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,010
It's very spacious.

183
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
It's very spacious.

184
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,010
This is a nice house.

185
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,010
Making money is different.

186
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,010
That's pretty amazing.

187
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,010
Did you put your camera in it?

188
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,010
I put the camera in.

189
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,010
Is this ok?

190
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,010
I am very happy.

191
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,010
I did as I was told.

192
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,010
But is it really good?

193
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,010
Are you afraid?

194
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,010
Don't be afraid of rent.

195
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,010
I will take all responsibility.

196
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,010
You only need to pay the rent.

197
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,010
Your goal is to rent.

198
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,010
sorry.

199
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,010
wait.

200
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,010
I told you I was shooting a magazine today.

201
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,010
I will be back soon.

202
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,010
Do it right.

203
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,010
I will ask you.

204
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,010
You can choose to befriend me.

205
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,010
I asked you.

206
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,010
goodbye.

207
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
Good luck.

208
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,010
goodbye.

209
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,010
You are the manager.

210
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,010
I'll let you go to the Aihan Temple first.

211
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,010
Today I'm going to meet a girl.

212
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,010
I got the key.

213
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,010
I gave it to the manager.

214
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,010
Do you understand it?

215
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,010
I am afraid.

216
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,010
I look forward to it.

217
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,010
You are so mean to make me rape the manager.

218
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,010
meaning is?

219
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,010
You will be more at ease knowing me.

220
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,010
I look forward to it.

221
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,010
cheers.

222
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,562
What?

223
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:29,762
What?

224
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,762
Aika-chan, long time no see.

225
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:36,506
You look so young.

226
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,506
Am I?

227
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,506
Yes.

228
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,610
You look so young.

229
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,578
how did you get in

230
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,650
What?

231
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,650
I'm in.

232
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,738
wait!

233
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:57,738
Let me go!

234
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,738
What?

235
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,738
stop!

236
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,290
stop!

237
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,290
wait!

238
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,290
What?

239
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,002
Do not touch me!

240
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:30,538
stop!

241
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,658
No! No! No!

242
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,910
No!

243
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:22,002
stop!

244
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,618
sorry.

245
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,618
are you sad

246
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:37,618
I'm a little sick.

247
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:41,618
I am very depressed.

248
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,618
sorry.

249
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,618
go home.

250
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:52,818
are you sad

251
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,658
Let me go.

252
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,786
sorry.

253
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,786
sorry.

254
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:11,066
sorry.

255
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,066
go home.

256
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,066
go home.

257
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,066
How are you?

258
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,066
You are noisy.

259
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,306
Yes!

260
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,802
Oh no!

261
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:15,842
I don't want to do it again.

262
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,842
You are a good girl.

263
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,842
You are a good girl.

264
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:26,418
You live a good life.

265
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,418
No!

266
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,978
Oh no!

267
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,978
stop!

268
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,202
I say it's not a scratch.

269
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,202
I say it's scratches.

270
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:29,202
Amazing.

271
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,850
Can't you hear something?

272
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,850
This apartment is really nice.

273
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,850
You live in a nice place.

274
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,530
I'll call and find out what happened.

275
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:09,194
Wait a moment.

276
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,938
I'm in pain.

277
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,938
You look miserable.

278
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:32,778
You are in big trouble.

279
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,234
How are you?

280
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:40,074
i want you to cry.

281
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:46,074
I will go to the hospital.

282
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:48,074
wait for me.

283
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,074
Did you see it?

284
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:56,074
I will go to the hospital.

285
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,074
go.

286
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:03,074
I don't want to go to the hospital.

287
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:35,426
No!

288
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,426
What's wrong?

289
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,426
No!

290
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:44,154
What is this place?

291
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:46,154
Amazing!

292
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:50,994
shut up!

293
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,706
Mao San!

294
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,706
what is going on?

295
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:05,706
What's wrong?

296
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,706
Mao San!

297
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,706
I think you're going to be in trouble!

298
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,706
Mao Saburo, help me!

299
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,706
Let me go!

300
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,706
What would you do if you got caught?

301
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,706
how was it before

302
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:21,706
What's this?

303
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:23,706
What are you doing?

304
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,706
Hey!

305
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:27,706
Let's record it.

306
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,706
We want to make a memory.

307
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,706
Hey!

308
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,706
Mao San!

309
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:35,706
Why?

310
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:37,706
I have to put this on the record.

311
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:39,706
Don't accept it.

312
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,706
I'm in trouble.

313
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,706
I'm in trouble.

314
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,706
stop!

315
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,706
You are a whore!

316
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,706
Mao San, why are you recording?

317
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,706
It's also a bitch.

318
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,706
stop!

319
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:55,706
You look fine.

320
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:57,706
You look the same as you did in your career.

321
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,706
You are a bitch.

322
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,706
let me see your face.

323
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,706
Take a good picture of my face.

324
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,706
Do you remember when you were working?

325
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,706
You are so carried away.

326
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,706
I will give you more.

327
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,706
stop!

328
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,706
What are you doing?

329
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:25,706
What are you doing?

330
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,194
stop!

331
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,194
are you embarrassed

332
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,194
Don't accept it.

333
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,194
You have shown your manko to many people.

334
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:42,266
stop!

335
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,266
stop!

336
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,266
Mao San is the No. 1 manco in the soap opera.

337
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,266
You're the #1 manko in a soap opera.

338
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,266
stop!

339
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,266
how do you feel?

340
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,266
I feel good.

341
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,266
stop!

342
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,266
What's this?

343
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,266
Did you feel it?

344
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,266
You are crazy.

345
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,266
Did you feel it?

346
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:14,266
You are a bitch.

347
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,266
You are a bitch.

348
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,266
stop!

349
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,266
stop!

350
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,882
You are bleeding.

351
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:24,882
Mao San!

352
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,882
how are you feeling

353
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,882
how are you feeling

354
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,146
stop!

355
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,146
why are you doing this

356
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,146
Because I don't answer do you feel good?

357
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,146
I ask you how you feel.

358
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,146
I do not feel well.

359
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:41,146
you are lying.

360
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:43,146
you are lying.

361
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,146
I don't want to do it again.

362
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,146
You feel it, don't you?

363
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,146
You don't feel it, do you?

364
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,146
I don't feel it.

365
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,146
What do you think of this face?

366
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:55,146
You feel it, don't you?

367
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,146
I really feel it.

368
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,146
Did you feel it?

369
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,146
Did you feel it?

370
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,146
stop!

371
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,146
You are a bitch.

372
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:11,146
What do you think of this?

373
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:15,146
how was it before

374
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:17,146
Do you still want to date Eka?

375
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,146
Do you still want to date Eka?

376
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:21,146
What do you think of this?

377
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,146
Don't show me.

378
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:25,146
Don't show me.

379
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:27,146
Don't show me.

380
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,146
I show you.

381
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:33,146
you are cute.

382
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,146
where are you going?

383
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:39,146
wait.

384
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,146
I am afraid.

385
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,146
I am afraid.

386
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:45,146
I am afraid.

387
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:47,146
Don't be crazy.

388
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:49,146
You are crazy.

389
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,146
Don't be crazy.

390
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:55,146
Don't be crazy.

391
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,146
How are you?

392
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,146
Are you sick?

393
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:07,146
Did you forget you're a girl?

394
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:11,146
You get a lot of love from me, don't you?

395
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,146
Today I'm going to make you cute again.

396
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,146
manager

397
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:21,146
stop.

398
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,146
Let me go.

399
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,146
very noisy.

400
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,146
This can cause problems for your neighbors.

401
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:37,146
What if you yelled loudly into your neighborhood?

402
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:39,146
what are you going to do?

403
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,146
If you are seen you will be in trouble.

404
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,146
Did you know I'm a cleaning lady?

405
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,146
I don't know what to do if you make noise.

406
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,146
do you understand?

407
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:59,146
Feel it.

408
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:01,146
stop.

409
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,146
stop.

410
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:05,146
stop.

411
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,146
stop.

412
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:11,146
very noisy.

413
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,146
sorry.

414
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:27,146
I'm glad I'm a good girl.

415
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:29,146
I'm glad I'm a good girl.

416
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,146
It's great to have so many lovely kids.

417
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:37,146
I'm glad I'm a good girl.

418
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:43,146
stop.

419
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,146
Don't you want to be seen?

420
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,146
I will cover your face.

421
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:51,146
stop.

422
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,146
You can't see my face, can you?

423
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:01,146
Do you want to feel good?

424
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,146
I am cold.

425
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:13,146
You are soaked.

426
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:15,146
You are soaked.

427
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,146
You are soaked.

428
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:19,146
You are soaked.

429
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,146
You're not happy with your boyfriend's penis, are you?

430
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,146
You are a bitch.

431
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,146
You're not happy with your boyfriend's penis, are you?

432
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:29,146
what do you think?

433
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,146
stop.

434
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:33,146
I will not stop.

435
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,146
wait.

436
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:41,146
Did you say it?

437
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:43,146
I did not say.

438
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:45,146
Did you say it?

439
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,146
I did not say.

440
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:51,146
Well, I'll let you do it.

441
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,146
I did not say.

442
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,146
I will let you do more.

443
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:01,146
You don't have enough love.

444
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:05,146
how are you feeling

445
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,146
how are you feeling

446
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:11,146
what happened to your face

447
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,146
You look like you're looking down on me.

448
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:17,146
you are annoying.

449
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:19,146
I know.

450
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,146
you are annoying.

451
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:25,146
You should stop it.

452
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,146
You should not do this.

453
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,146
You are a bitch.

454
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,146
You are a bitch.

455
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:39,146
You are a bitch.

456
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:44,018
you bite me.

457
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:48,018
you bite me.

458
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,018
Apologize to me.

459
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:52,018
Get your legs off.

460
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,018
I do not want.

461
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:56,018
Why do I have to take my legs off?

462
00:27:56,018 --> 00:27:58,018
Your legs look fine.

463
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:02,018
You look so good in such beautiful lingerie.

464
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:06,018
You are a bitch.

465
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:10,018
You are a bitch.

466
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,018
You are a bitch.

467
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:14,018
You are a bitch.

468
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:20,018
You are used to it.

469
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:26,018
leave.

470
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,018
leave.

471
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:30,018
I do not want.

472
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:32,018
I'm going to sleep.

473
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:34,018
I'm going to sleep.

474
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:36,018
I'm going to sleep.

475
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,018
I'm going to sleep.

476
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:40,746
You should be more submissive to her.

477
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:41,746
No!

478
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,746
Do you think you are a man?

479
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:49,746
If you are the same woman, you will be angry.

480
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,746
You are not good enough.

481
00:29:54,746 --> 00:29:56,746
stop!

482
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:57,746
Do not touch me!

483
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:03,746
You still have a beautiful face.

484
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:04,746
stop!

485
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:07,746
You seduced me with your body.

486
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:08,746
turn around.

487
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:11,746
stop!

488
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:18,642
What's wrong?

489
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,642
why are you so excited

490
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:22,642
sorry.

491
00:30:22,642 --> 00:30:24,642
turn around.

492
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:29,642
where are you going?

493
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:30,642
No!

494
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:37,642
where are you going?

495
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:38,642
go home!

496
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:40,642
Do you think you can escape?

497
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:46,642
stop!

498
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:49,642
why are you trying to escape

499
00:30:49,642 --> 00:30:53,642
If you escape, this video will go viral.

500
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:58,642
Let's take a photo together as 1.3 million people watch this video.

501
00:30:58,642 --> 00:30:59,642
No!

502
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:02,642
Let's show this to 1.3 million people.

503
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:06,642
I think we can get more followers.

504
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:09,642
You are more beautiful.

505
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:13,642
No!

506
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:18,642
you are so cute.

507
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:22,642
Your face looks good.

508
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,642
Let's show them.

509
00:31:24,642 --> 00:31:27,642
No!

510
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:36,242
why are you so excited

511
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,242
No!

512
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:41,242
You pretended to leave again.

513
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:45,242
You are a liar.

514
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:46,242
No!

515
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:48,242
You pretended to leave again.

516
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,242
It's not over yet.

517
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,242
OK?

518
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,242
Let's stop it.

519
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:54,242
stop.

520
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:56,242
Hey!

521
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:58,242
No!

522
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,242
You are noisy.

523
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:07,242
You are noisy.

524
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:09,242
open mouth.

525
00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:11,242
Open it.

526
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:15,242
don't bite me.

527
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:17,242
You are bitten.

528
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:21,242
That's why you make that sound.

529
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,242
Do you know what will happen if you bite me?

531
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:45,242
bite me again

532
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:48,242
you are too naive.

533
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:50,242
bite me again

534
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:53,242
bite me again

535
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:54,242
can you bite me

536
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:56,242
deeper.

537
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,242
deeper.

538
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,242
look at me.

539
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,242
look at me.

540
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:11,242
look at me.

541
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,242
look at me.

542
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:18,242
You are so wet.

543
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:21,242
Does it hurt?

544
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:26,242
It's not over yet.

545
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:30,242
Why are you trying to end it?

546
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,242
It's not over yet.

547
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:40,242
It's not over yet.

548
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,242
You are noisy.

549
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,242
how are you feeling

550
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,242
I feel good.

551
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:51,242
Your expression is very strange.

552
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:58,282
You are so naughty.

553
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:01,282
You want to run away, don't you?

554
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:03,282
Are you waiting for me?

555
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:17,498
What's this?

556
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,498
I've never seen anything like it.

557
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:25,306
You look bad.

558
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,306
looking at you.

559
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:32,306
Is this ok?

560
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,306
Don't push me.

561
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:39,306
I can push you.

562
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:41,306
No.

563
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,306
You look bad.

564
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,306
looking at you.

565
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:50,306
I've never seen anything like it.

566
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,306
stop.

567
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,306
I'm done.

568
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,306
You want to run away, don't you?

569
00:34:57,306 --> 00:35:00,306
Where can you escape to?

570
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:02,306
stop.

571
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:18,858
If you get mad at me, you'll get hurt.

572
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:20,858
I'm fine.

573
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:22,858
I'm fine.

574
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:24,858
I'm fine.

575
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:29,282
stop!

576
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:32,282
Is Aika's microphone turned off?

577
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:34,282
I think so.

578
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:38,282
The manager said he wanted a baby.

579
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:41,282
I'll call him for you.

580
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:43,282
I'll call him for you.

581
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:45,282
stop!

582
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:50,282
You are rich and can support two children.

583
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,282
I don't want to do that!

584
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:58,282
If you turn off the microphone, the manager will cry.

585
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:02,282
stop!

586
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:05,282
I don't want to do that!

587
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:08,282
You are desperate.

588
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:11,282
You look up.

589
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,282
Just look at Aika.

590
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,282
You look up.

591
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,282
You are feeling it.

592
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,282
You feel it with your head.

593
00:36:20,282 --> 00:36:22,282
I don't want to do that.

594
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:26,282
You look up.

595
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:29,282
You can feel it with your head.

596
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:31,282
You can feel it, right?

597
00:36:31,282 --> 00:36:33,282
No.

598
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:35,282
No.

599
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:40,282
I don't want to do that.

600
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,282
I don't want to do that.

601
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:45,282
You look up.

602
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:48,282
can you feel it

603
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:51,282
I will give you a shock.

604
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:53,282
yeah!

605
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:59,282
Aika's pussy is with the manager's cock.

606
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:02,282
look at this.

607
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:05,282
You can see the hole in the ass.

608
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:07,282
stop!

609
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:10,282
This is the hole in the ass of celebrities.

610
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:13,282
You are shaking.

611
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:16,282
stop!

612
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:20,282
You smell like a woman.

613
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:23,290
stop!

614
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,290
stop!

615
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,290
stop!

616
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,290
turn around.

617
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,290
You are kissing.

618
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,290
open mouth.

619
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,290
open mouth.

620
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,290
You are kissing.

621
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,290
This is a silent attack.

622
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,290
You are so disgusting.

623
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,290
You are so disgusting.

624
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,290
You are so disgusting.

625
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,290
You are so disgusting.

626
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,290
You are so disgusting.

627
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,290
You are so disgusting.

628
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,290
stop!

629
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:22,858
Why?

630
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:26,858
Your back is shaking.

631
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:28,858
are you sure?

632
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:30,858
you're lying, aren't you?

633
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:32,858
you are lying.

634
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:34,858
You are lying again.

635
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,858
You don't have enough energy.

636
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:42,858
You don't have enough energy.

637
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:45,858
where are you going?

638
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,858
No!

639
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:55,858
let me go home.

640
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:57,858
you are lying.

641
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:00,858
you are lying.

642
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:02,858
No!

643
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:04,858
No!

644
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:06,858
what are you going to do?

645
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:08,858
I can not.

646
00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:10,858
I can not.

647
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,858
Do you want to get back to your colleagues?

648
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:18,858
Let's work together again.

649
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:19,858
I can not.

650
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,858
what are you going to do?

651
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:24,858
what are you going to do?

652
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:27,858
what are you going to do?

653
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:29,858
I can not.

654
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:32,858
you are annoying.

655
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:35,858
Let me touch you more.

656
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:37,858
Let me touch you more.

657
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:39,858
I will eat you.

658
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:41,858
stop.

659
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:43,858
you are lying.

660
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:48,538
Your back is shaking.

661
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:01,682
What do you think of this gift?

662
00:40:02,682 --> 00:40:03,682
do you like it

663
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:05,682
I'm tired.

664
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:07,682
let me see.

665
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:09,682
Mother.

666
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,682
tell me you're going.

667
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:14,682
I do not understand.

668
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:18,682
Will you stop me if I go?

669
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:21,682
I will think about it.

670
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:23,682
go ahead.

671
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:25,682
go.

672
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:27,682
go.

673
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:30,682
As a woman, you can't even breathe.

674
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,682
I gotta go.

675
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:34,682
I gotta go.

676
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:39,682
Do you think this is true?

677
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:42,682
This is a lie.

678
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:44,682
don't lie.

679
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,746
I am a woman.

680
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:50,746
stop.

681
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,746
I'm glad you couldn't break it.

682
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:55,746
It's wet.

683
00:40:58,746 --> 00:40:59,746
stop.

684
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,746
Do you get wet when you dance?

685
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:03,746
No?

686
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:05,746
you like me.

687
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:07,746
you like me.

688
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:09,746
I am very happy.

689
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:11,746
tell me.

690
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,746
You like me more than your boyfriend.

691
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:16,746
I never liked you.

692
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:18,746
what are you saying?

693
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:21,746
I can not.

694
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,746
I can not.

695
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:27,010
stop.

696
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,010
stop.

697
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,010
I'm glad you're feeling better.

698
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,010
You feel better, don't you?

699
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,010
I am very happy.

700
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,010
You are in luck.

701
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,010
I am very happy.

702
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,010
When you say I leave, you also leave.

703
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,010
I gotta go.

704
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,010
go.

705
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,010
I gotta go.

706
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,010
I gotta go.

707
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,530
don't stop me.

708
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,530
I gotta go.

709
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,530
don't stop me.

710
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,530
don't stop me.

711
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,530
I gotta go.

712
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,530
I gotta go.

713
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,530
I gotta go.

714
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,530
I'd be happy if you went.

715
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,530
I gotta go.

716
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,530
stop.

717
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,530
stop.

718
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,462
stop!

719
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:32,042
I am still young.

720
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:36,194
you...

721
00:42:36,194 --> 00:42:38,194
you...

722
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:40,194
Do not move.

723
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:44,194
It seems that you are the favorite.

724
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,194
You can do it.

725
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:48,194
You can do it.

726
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,194
stop.

727
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:52,194
stop.

728
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,194
May I?

729
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,194
May I?

730
00:42:58,194 --> 00:43:00,194
May I?

731
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:04,194
You said you liked being pushed from behind.

732
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:10,194
You said you liked being pushed from behind.

733
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:12,194
You are a bitch.

734
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,194
You are still very young.

735
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:22,194
You say you want to go.

736
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:26,970
I do not know what you're talking about.

737
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,970
I can not hear you.

738
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,170
You are a bitch.

739
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,966
You are a bitch.

740
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:37,994
OMG!

741
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:39,994
OMG!

742
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,890
OMG!

743
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,890
OMG!

744
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,954
OMG!

745
00:43:48,954 --> 00:43:51,890
OMG!

746
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,890
OMG!

747
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,890
OMG!

748
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,890
OMG!

749
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,890
OMG!

750
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,890
OMG!

751
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,890
OMG!

752
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,890
OMG!

753
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,890
OMG!

754
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,442
enough!

755
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,210
I do not think so.

756
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,210
You can enjoy a lot.

757
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,210
She hasn't enjoyed it yet.

758
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,210
You should close the door more often.

759
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,210
What?

760
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,210
Are you closing the door too tightly?

761
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,210
I told you.

762
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,210
I told you it was over.

763
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,210
you have not.

764
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,210
I told you.

765
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,210
you have not.

766
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,210
you lied to me.

767
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,210
I don't.

768
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,210
You haven't closed the door yet.

769
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,210
Would you like to close the door even tighter?

770
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,210
I want you to enjoy it more.

771
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,210
I do not want.

772
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,210
Do you still want to go to the bathroom again?

773
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,210
I do not want.

774
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,210
Do you enjoy it so much?

775
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,210
Do you still want to go to the bathroom again?

776
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,210
I will help you.

777
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:38,210
stop!

778
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,402
don't stop me!

779
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:49,902
Hey manager, come with me!

780
00:45:49,902 --> 00:45:50,902
Oh no!

781
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:54,402
When I run I'm tired and I'm like...

782
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:57,402
I'm so scared, I'm about to lose my mind!

783
00:46:00,402 --> 00:46:01,902
What's wrong?

784
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:04,902
What's wrong?

785
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:06,402
Are you running away again?

786
00:46:06,402 --> 00:46:08,402
With your manager's cock?

787
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:11,902
Check that out and tell me.

788
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:14,902
look at this.

789
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,402
I can't tell!

790
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:19,902
I told you, if you don't talk, it won't end.

791
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:22,902
Light...

792
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:23,902
who?

793
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:27,402
whose dick?

794
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,902
Manager's...

795
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:33,902
I'm going.

796
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:39,530
Light, light, light, light...

797
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:52,746
I can not believe it.

798
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:54,746
too disgusting.

799
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:03,746
be careful.

800
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:09,746
can you see it

801
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:15,746
This is your favorite host tent.

802
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,746
No no no.

803
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:20,746
I gotta go.

804
00:47:20,746 --> 00:47:22,746
I gotta go.

805
00:47:22,746 --> 00:47:24,746
I gotta go.

806
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:25,746
No.

807
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:27,746
look carefully.

808
00:47:27,746 --> 00:47:28,746
No.

809
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,746
look carefully.

810
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:32,746
No.

811
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,266
manager!

812
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:48,266
What?

813
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,266
We are talking about other things.

814
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,266
What?

815
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:54,266
I told you to put it in.

816
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,266
why did you put it there?

817
00:47:56,266 --> 00:47:58,266
I have no idea.

818
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,266
Put it in now.

819
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,266
I'm done.

820
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:05,266
put it in.

821
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,266
it's over.

822
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:09,266
sorry.

823
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:12,266
Let's do it again.

824
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:14,266
Don't put it in.

825
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,266
Why?

826
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:17,266
I put it in.

827
00:48:17,266 --> 00:48:19,266
I put it in.

828
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:24,266
It's not over until you put it in.

829
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,266
I told you.

830
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:29,266
I want a child.

831
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:32,266
I don't know if it's a baby.

832
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:34,266
It doesn't move.

833
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:36,266
That's right.

834
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,266
It's a baby.

835
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,266
It's a baby.

836
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,266
It doesn't move.

837
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:44,266
squeeze it out.

838
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:46,266
It's a baby.

839
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:50,394
squeeze it out.

840
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,394
You want a baby, don't you?

841
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:56,394
I'm the manager's baby.

842
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,394
You want a baby, don't you?

843
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,394
You want a baby, don't you?

844
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:02,394
Say you want a baby.

845
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:06,394
I will make this video popular.

846
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:09,394
I want a child.

847
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,394
Hurry up.

848
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:14,394
I tell you to move.

849
00:49:14,394 --> 00:49:16,394
I can not.

850
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:20,394
When you're a manager, you do it better.

851
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:23,394
You can't do this anymore.

852
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,394
You can move, right?

853
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:30,394
I will tell you the real thing.

854
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:34,394
Otherwise the manager...

855
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:36,394
You must move.

856
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:38,394
you should not.

857
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:43,394
May I?

858
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:47,394
Can I show you pictures of 130,000 people?

859
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:50,394
with your boyfriend?

860
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,394
can i show you

861
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:55,394
Then you know what I'm talking about.

862
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:02,394
stop.

863
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:07,394
Please stop.

864
00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:09,394
stop.

865
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:11,394
Do you want to feel it?

866
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:13,394
Or do you want something stronger?

867
00:50:13,394 --> 00:50:15,394
stop.

868
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:18,434
I will take your tits.

869
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,434
How do you like it?

870
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:24,434
stop.

871
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:27,434
You will.

872
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:31,434
You will.

873
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:34,434
I can not.

874
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,434
I can not.

875
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:39,506
stop.

876
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:41,898
stop.

877
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:45,258
sorry.

878
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,258
Please put the manager's nipples in.

879
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:52,258
The video will be played around the world.

880
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,258
Speak.

881
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:56,258
manager.

882
00:50:57,258 --> 00:51:00,258
Manager, please put my nipples in.

883
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,258
Where?

884
00:51:04,258 --> 00:51:08,258
Please put my nipples in.

885
00:51:08,258 --> 00:51:10,258
stop.

886
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:12,258
No.

887
00:51:12,258 --> 00:51:15,674
No.

888
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:24,266
I'm going to cry.

889
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,266
No!

890
00:51:26,266 --> 00:51:28,266
I must act alone.

891
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:32,994
No!

892
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:37,338
stop!

893
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:44,138
How are you?

894
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:46,138
Take a good photo.

895
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,138
I can not get in

896
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:52,138
help me!

897
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:05,418
how?

898
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:07,418
are you happy?

899
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,418
let's see.

900
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:14,426
you are so happy.

901
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:17,426
You take a lot of photos.

902
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,426
are you happy?

903
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:24,426
Take a picture of me.

904
00:52:25,426 --> 00:52:31,426
Let's take a picture together.

905
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:33,426
Let's put it all together.

906
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:42,426
You take a lot of photos.

907
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,426
fun.

908
00:52:47,426 --> 00:52:49,426
It's not over yet.

909
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:53,426
Let's take a break and move on.

910
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,250
I'm hungry.

911
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,250
I have nothing.

912
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,290
Hey!

913
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:59,602
cheers!

914
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,850
look at this.

915
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,850
How long are you going to do this?

916
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,850
It's amazing.

917
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,370
I am not going to eat this. It's amazing.

918
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,890
I am very tired.

919
00:54:41,618 --> 00:54:43,618
manager.

920
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,618
How many times have you said this sentence?

921
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,618
You talk too much.

922
00:54:51,618 --> 00:54:53,618
show me.

923
00:54:57,618 --> 00:54:59,618
I am Norwegian.

924
00:55:01,618 --> 00:55:03,618
I couldn't breathe with excitement.

925
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:06,618
I'm so glad you gave me lots of photos.

926
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:14,618
Show me a picture of your boyfriend.

927
00:55:15,618 --> 00:55:16,618
No.

928
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,618
Why? He is your friend.

929
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:21,618
show me.

930
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:23,618
No?

931
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:26,618
Then you can be alone.

932
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:27,618
show me.

933
00:55:32,618 --> 00:55:33,618
This is your bag, isn't it?

934
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:35,618
stop.

935
00:55:36,618 --> 00:55:37,618
stop.

936
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,322
don't touch it.

937
00:55:50,322 --> 00:55:52,322
This is it.

938
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:54,322
This is a picture of you and me.

939
00:55:56,322 --> 00:55:58,322
You look so cute.

940
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,322
What are you taking pictures of?

941
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:03,322
This is good.

942
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:05,322
I am so embarrassed.

943
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,322
Let's take a picture together.

944
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:10,618
What?

945
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,618
When are you coming to see me?

946
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:17,626
I'll see you when you're not wearing your coat.

947
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:18,626
I am a manager.

948
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,626
You are young, but you are amazing.

949
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:23,626
You are the manager now, right?

950
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:30,626
But you are naked.

951
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:33,626
stop.

952
00:56:34,626 --> 00:56:35,626
I do not want.

953
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:42,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

954
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:44,626
What?

955
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:46,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

956
00:56:47,626 --> 00:56:48,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

957
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:51,626
manager.

958
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:53,626
give me a drink.

959
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:55,626
No.

960
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:57,626
Why?

961
00:56:58,626 --> 00:56:59,626
You want to go to the bathroom, right?

962
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:01,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

963
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:04,626
come over.

964
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:08,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

965
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,626
Please take it.

966
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:13,626
hurry up.

967
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,626
You want me to do it here, right?

968
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:18,626
Do you want me to hide it?

969
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:24,626
I can't use the bathroom.

970
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:27,626
I'll keep it or do it here.

971
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:31,626
hurry up.

972
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:36,106
I am so embarrassed.

973
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:40,106
I know you can't take pictures, so hurry up.

974
00:57:41,106 --> 00:57:42,106
I am so embarrassed.

975
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:47,106
You are embarrassed by looking at me.

976
00:57:49,106 --> 00:57:51,106
You can't hold on, can you?

977
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:54,106
I keep it to myself.

978
00:57:57,882 --> 00:57:59,882
I keep it to myself.

979
00:58:03,402 --> 00:58:05,402
You have been holding on all this time.

980
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:16,402
You have been holding on all this time.

981
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:22,402
You are soaked.

982
00:58:23,402 --> 00:58:24,402
manager.

983
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,402
manager.

984
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:29,402
I can't hold it anymore

985
00:58:31,402 --> 00:58:32,402
I can't hold it anymore

986
00:58:33,402 --> 00:58:34,402
Why?

987
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,402
I can't hold it anymore

988
00:58:39,402 --> 00:58:42,402
You're wet, so wipe it off.

989
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:44,402
do i have to wipe it off?

990
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,402
This is your mouth.

991
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:48,402
hurry up.

992
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:49,402
No.

993
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,402
You can't do that.

994
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:54,402
I can not.

995
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:02,858
are you serious.

996
00:59:02,858 --> 00:59:04,858
OMG!

997
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:07,858
How does it taste?

998
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,858
salty.

999
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:14,962
You are a good boy.

1000
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:17,962
You are full of energy.

1001
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:23,962
I'm not done yet.

1002
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:26,962
Afterwards you invite your friends, right?

1003
00:59:26,962 --> 00:59:27,962
Yes.

1004
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:31,962
I don't like nudity.

1005
00:59:31,962 --> 00:59:33,962
It's embarrassing.

1006
00:59:33,962 --> 00:59:35,962
This is not good.

1007
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:36,962
Wait a moment.

1008
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:38,962
what is that?

1009
00:59:38,962 --> 00:59:40,962
Wait a moment.

1010
00:59:40,962 --> 00:59:45,050
I do not care.

1011
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,050
Do you want to do it again?

1012
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,050
No.

1013
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,050
I do not care.

1014
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,050
I will take this.

1015
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,050

1016
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,050
don't you wear it

1017
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,050
I don't care if you're naked or not.

1018
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,050
It's embarrassing.

1019
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,058
This is good.

1020
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:08,058
You are a good boy.

1021
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:11,058
hurry up.

1022
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:34,514
She really came.

1023
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:36,514
She is a wonderful person.

1024
01:00:36,514 --> 01:00:38,514
She is a wonderful person.

1025
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,514
you are always like this.

1026
01:00:40,514 --> 01:00:42,514
She is great.

1027
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,514
She is really good.

1028
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:46,514
she is so cute.

1029
01:00:46,514 --> 01:00:48,514
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1030
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:50,514
I'm Aika.

1031
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:52,514
I'm Aika.

1032
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:54,514
sit down.

1033
01:00:54,514 --> 01:00:56,514

today,

1039
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:12,514
I'll play with you all I want.

1040
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:14,514
You can do whatever you want.

1041
01:01:14,514 --> 01:01:16,514
Really?

1042
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:18,514
I want you to do this.

1043
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:20,514

I will kiss you.

1050
01:01:40,474 --> 01:01:42,474
Do not move.

1051
01:01:47,058 --> 01:01:49,058
You are so good at it.

1052
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:51,058
You are so good at it.

1053
01:01:51,058 --> 01:01:53,058
Next, go this way.

1087
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:21,706
I don't want to wait.

1088
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:23,706
You are getting bigger and bigger.

1089
01:03:28,706 --> 01:03:29,706
No!

you like it.

1108
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:08,706
I like both.

1109

1118
01:04:34,706 --> 01:04:35,706
stop.

1119
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,706
You use it many times.

1120
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:39,706
Do you use it a lot?

1121
01:04:40,706 --> 01:04:41,706
You are licking it.

1122
01:04:50,706 --> 01:04:52,706
You lick it from the top of your panties.

1123
01:04:54,706 --> 01:04:55,706
like this?

1124
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:57,706

01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:02,706
you can see.

1127
01:05:08,706 --> 01:05:09,706
you like it, don't you?

1128
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,706
you bastard.

1129
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:14,706
You say you like it.

1130
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:16,706
Your voice is missing.

1131
01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:21,706
You use it a lot.

1132
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:23,706
Let me go.

1133
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:25,706
No.

1134
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:29,706

1135
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:39,706
You are scratching your body.

1136
01:05:40,706 --> 01:05:41,706
You are bothering me.

1137
01:05:46,514 --> 01:05:47,514
You are scratching your body.

1138
01:05:48,514 --> 01:05:49,514
wait.

1139
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,514
Why are you acting like a nice guy?

1140
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,514
What?

1141
01:05:56,514 --> 01:06:00,514
When I go to you, you should say you will go.

1142
01:06:01,514 --> 01:06:02,514
so what?

1143
01:06:06,554 --> 01:06:07,554
let's go.

1144
01:06:17,226 --> 01:06:18,226
No.

1145
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,226

1146
01:06:22,226 --> 01:06:23,226

1147
01:06:30,226 --> 01:06:31,226
you are leaving.

1148
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,226
I'm going.

1149
01:06:38,226 --> 01:06:39,226
I'm going to take a lot of pictures.

1150
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:42,226

1151
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:45,226

01:06:46,226 --> 01:06:47,226
stop.

1153
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:52,226
You use it a lot.

1154
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:54,226
You use it a lot.

1155
01:06:55,226 --> 01:06:56,226
stop.

1156
01:07:00,226 --> 01:07:01,226
You are bothering me.

1157
01:07:04,226 --> 01:07:05,226
I'm going to clean it up.

1158
01:07:13,226 --> 01:07:14,226
You are very happy.

1159
01:07:18,226 --> 01:07:20,194

1160
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:22,194
You are scratching your body.

1161
01:07:23,194 --> 01:07:24,194
You use it a lot.

1162
01:07:27,194 --> 01:07:28,194
wait.

1163
01:07:29,194 --> 01:07:30,194
What?

1164
01:07:31,194 --> 01:07:32,194
Speak.

1165
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:35,194

01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:38,802
stop.

1167
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:40,802
You can't use it.

1168
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:44,802
how?

1169
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:46,802

You want to go.

1172
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:53,802
I do not think so.

1173
01:07:54,802 --> 01:07:55,802
stop.

1174
01:08:14,082 --> 01:08:15,082

1176
01:08:19,082 --> 01:08:20,082
You want to go.

01:08:21,082 --> 01:08:22,082
You want to go.

1178
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:24,082
how?

1179
01:08:24,082 --> 01:08:26,082
If I say so you can go.

1180
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:32,082
Show me your erotic expressions.

1181
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:34,082

1184
01:08:43,082 --> 01:08:44,082
What's this?

1185
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:48,082
You wear this when you are active.

1186
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,082
I will make you stronger.

1187
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:53,082

You can't use it yet.

1202
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:33,882
I will make you stronger.

1203
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:36,882
Your hips are moving.

1204
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,882
Put your knees on top.

1205
01:09:39,882 --> 01:09:40,882
stop.

1206
01:09:42,882 --> 01:09:43,882
Show me your erotic expressions.

You are very angry.

1209
01:09:49,882 --> 01:09:50,882
stop.

1210
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:54,882
What expression is that?

1211
01:09:56,882 --> 01:09:57,882
Don't stare at me.

1212
01:09:58,882 --> 01:09:59,882
What?

1213
01:10:00,882 --> 01:10:01,882
You want to go?

1214
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:03,882
how?

1215

01:10:08,882 --> 01:10:09,882
I'm going.

1217
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:15,882
What?

1218
01:10:16,882 --> 01:10:17,882
I can not hear you.

1219
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:18,882

I want to hear your voice.

1222
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:24,882
I do not want to say.

1223
01:10:28,882 --> 01:10:30,882
If you keep putting on that look, you're going to be pissed off.

1224
01:10:31,882 --> 01:10:32,882
hurry up.

1225
01:10:33,882 --> 01:10:34,882

You two let her go.

1230

I do not want to go.

1231
01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:51,114
You are a pervert.

1232
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:54,114
stop.

1233
01:10:56,114 --> 01:10:57,114
Don't accept it.

1234
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:13,034
you are so cute.

1235
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:17,034
I put her on the bed first.

1236
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:19,034
She feels it inside.

1237
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:26,034
You like this bed, don't you?

1238
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,034
You are not good at it.

1239
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:32,034
You should attack her from the inside.

1240
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:34,034
You are very good at it.

1241
01:11:34,034 --> 01:11:35,034
I'm not.

1242
01:11:35,034 --> 01:11:38,034
You put her to bed early.

1243
01:11:39,034 --> 01:11:41,034
Are you sleepy?

1244
01:11:42,034 --> 01:11:44,034
You do not want?

1245
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:46,034
do you want to stay here

1246
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:50,034
You should get her wet.

1247
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:01,034
You should get her wet.

1248
01:12:03,034 --> 01:12:04,034
good girl.

1249
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,034
you are cute.

1250
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:16,034
You are soaked.

1251
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,034
You still do it.

1252
01:12:21,034 --> 01:12:23,034
You should put her to bed.

1253
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:25,034
You should get her wet.

1254
01:12:27,034 --> 01:12:29,034
You are still wet.

1255
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:31,034
more.

1256
01:12:31,034 --> 01:12:32,034
more.

1257
01:12:40,226 --> 01:12:42,226
You are still wet.

1258
01:12:46,226 --> 01:12:48,226
You are still wet.

1259
01:12:48,226 --> 01:12:50,226
you are so cute.

1260
01:12:52,226 --> 01:12:54,226
You should get her wet.

1261
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:59,226
you are cute.

1262
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:06,034
You are dirty.

1263
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,034
You are soaked.

1264
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:12,034
You are soaked.

1265
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:14,034
what do you want to do?

1266
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:18,034
You are soaked.

1267
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:20,034
what do you want to do?

1268
01:13:20,034 --> 01:13:22,034
Do you want to be attacked?

1269
01:13:22,034 --> 01:13:24,034
you can sleep.

1270
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,034
You want to be attacked.

1271
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,034
you are so cute.

1272
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:33,034
You are under attack.

1273
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,034
you are so cute.

1274
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:44,682
stop.

1275
01:13:44,682 --> 01:13:46,682
look at her.

1276
01:13:46,682 --> 01:13:48,682
stop.

1277
01:13:50,682 --> 01:13:53,010
Don't put her in bed.

1278
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,330
you are so cute.

1279
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,330
You can't touch her.

1280
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:09,330
You can't touch her.

1281
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,330
You are so wet.

1282
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,330
you are beautiful.

1283
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,330
you are so cute.

1284
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,330
You like to be attacked.

1285
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:31,330
You like to be attacked.

1286
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,330
You like to be attacked.

1287
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,330
stop.

1288
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,330
You are so wet.

1289
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,594
stop.

1290
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:45,594
No.

1291
01:14:45,594 --> 01:14:47,594
stop.

1292
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:01,714
You can't touch her.

1293
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:03,714
You can't touch her.

1294
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:12,490
I don't want to cry.

1295
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,490
No.

1296
01:15:24,042 --> 01:15:26,042
That's pretty amazing.

1297
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:28,042
I will do it.

1298
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:34,042
I'm not in a good mood.

1299
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:36,042
I'm not in a good mood.

1300
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:43,042
What's this?

1301
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:45,042
What's this? tell me.

1302
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:47,042
what does it feel like

1303
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,042
I have never experienced this.

1304
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:52,042
What's this?

1305
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:54,042
stop.

1306
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,010
tell me.

1307
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,010
stop.

1308
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,010
stop.

1309
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,170
I feel something.

1310
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,170
This is...

1311
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,170
More violent.

1312
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,170
I'm not in a good mood.

1313
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,170
More violent.

1314
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,170
stop.

1315
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,978
That's pretty amazing.

1316
01:16:28,978 --> 01:16:30,978
stop.

1317
01:16:30,978 --> 01:16:32,978
stop.

1318
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:34,978
I will do it.

1319
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:36,978
I am in a good mood.

1320
01:16:37,978 --> 01:16:39,978
stop.

1321
01:16:39,978 --> 01:16:41,978
stop.

1322
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:44,978
Which one is bigger?

1323
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:48,978
stop.

1324
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:59,586
You said you wouldn't let me go.

1325
01:16:59,586 --> 01:17:03,586
You said you wouldn't let me go.

1326
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:09,586
help me.

1327
01:17:09,586 --> 01:17:11,586
help me.

1328
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,882
help me.

1329
01:17:13,882 --> 01:17:18,546
i will cry.

1330
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:20,546
i will cry.

1331
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:23,674
No.

1332
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:35,634
You like to live forever, don't you?

1333
01:17:49,626 --> 01:17:51,626
Do not say!

1334
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:07,626
don't you hurt?

1335
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:09,626
Hey let me read your face.

1336
01:18:09,626 --> 01:18:11,626
Do not move.

1337
01:18:11,626 --> 01:18:14,626
Admin, put this in.

1338
01:18:14,626 --> 01:18:17,626
Let me read your face.

1339
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:21,626
Do you think this will work?

1340
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:23,626
Maybe a little too much.

1341
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:25,626
Because you didn't react well.

1342
01:18:25,626 --> 01:18:27,626
That is not true.

1343
01:18:27,626 --> 01:18:29,626
I can only say no.

1344
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,626
Then, put this in.

1345
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:33,626
what should I do?

1346
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,626
Might be great if you drink from here.

1347
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:37,626
sorry.

1348
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,626
here we go.

1349
01:18:39,626 --> 01:18:41,626
one two.

1350
01:18:52,698 --> 01:18:55,090
OMG!

1351
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:59,050
OMG!

1352
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,050
It smells so good!

1353
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,050
It smells so good!

1354
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:05,050
It smells so good!

1355
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,050
Manager, that's not enough!

1356
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,050
more!

1357
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,050
For our friendship!

1358
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,050
For our friendship!

1359
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,050
cheers!

1360
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,050
cheers!

1361
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,378
No!

1362
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:21,378
Shake it!

1363
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:24,346
OMG!

1364
01:19:24,346 --> 01:19:26,346
do you want to see me

1365
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:29,538
No!

1366
01:19:29,538 --> 01:19:31,538
get ready?

1367
01:19:36,698 --> 01:19:43,698
If you drink that much, you will get sick.

1368
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,698
You want to drink, don't you?

1369
01:19:48,698 --> 01:19:50,698
I want to drink.

1370
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:52,698
I can drink.

1371
01:19:52,698 --> 01:19:54,698
drink.

1372
01:19:54,698 --> 01:19:56,698
It's delicious.

1373
01:19:58,698 --> 01:20:00,698
Is this your first experience?

1374
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:01,698
Yes.

1375
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:11,698
Stop talking, stop talking.

1376
01:20:11,698 --> 01:20:13,698
do you understand?

1377
01:20:13,698 --> 01:20:16,698
look at this mouth.

1378
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:19,698
look at this.

1379
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:22,698
What is in front of you?

1380
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:27,698
What is in front of you?

1381
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,698
Are you not drinking enough?

1382
01:20:29,698 --> 01:20:31,698
I want to drink.

1383
01:20:31,698 --> 01:20:36,698
You want to drink, don't you?

1384
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,698
i want to touch you.

1385
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:43,698
Do not touch me.

1386
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:47,698
Do not touch me.

1387
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:49,698
Are you not drinking enough?

1388
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:52,698
If you don't do well, I will do it again.

1389
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:57,698
You should drink it right.

1390
01:20:58,698 --> 01:21:01,698
Is it tasty?

1391
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:06,698
look at the camera.

1392
01:21:06,698 --> 01:21:11,698
I am sick.

1393
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,698
I do not know what you're talking about.

1394
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:16,698
Don't do that.

1395
01:21:16,698 --> 01:21:18,698
I want to drink.

1396
01:21:18,698 --> 01:21:21,698
I am sick.

1397
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:30,802
I am sick.

1398
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:34,802
You didn't say you wanted to drink.

1399
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:38,802
I said.

1400
01:21:38,802 --> 01:21:43,802
You should lick it properly.

1401
01:21:43,802 --> 01:21:46,802
this is the best.

1402
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,802
You are getting bigger and bigger.

1403
01:21:48,802 --> 01:21:49,802
this is the best.

1404
01:21:49,802 --> 01:21:53,802
You are getting bigger and bigger.

1405
01:21:54,802 --> 01:21:57,802
You are very good at licking.

1406
01:21:57,802 --> 01:22:00,802
You are very good at licking.

1407
01:22:00,802 --> 01:22:05,802
You are a soap woman.

1408
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:07,802
You should lick us.

1409
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:10,802
I'm going to sleep.

1410
01:22:10,802 --> 01:22:13,802
I am sick.

1411
01:22:13,802 --> 01:22:16,802
You should do it correctly.

1412
01:22:16,802 --> 01:22:21,802
You know what's in the video, don't you?

1413
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:24,802
I believe everyone wants to see it.

1414
01:22:24,802 --> 01:22:27,802
You are a soap woman.

1415
01:22:27,802 --> 01:22:31,802
You are a good girl.

1416
01:22:31,802 --> 01:22:38,802
You are a good girl.

1417
01:22:38,802 --> 01:22:40,802
Did you spit it out?

1418
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:49,802
You are a good girl.

1419
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:54,802
You are a good girl.

1420
01:22:54,802 --> 01:22:59,730
You are a good girl.

1421
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:06,634
You are a good girl.

1422
01:23:06,634 --> 01:23:10,634
You are eating with Manco.

1423
01:23:10,634 --> 01:23:14,634
Love Card's Manco.

1424
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:17,634
Love Card's Manco.

1425
01:23:17,634 --> 01:23:21,634
I will do it now.

1426
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:27,634
go.

1427
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:49,386
I will do it now.

1428
01:23:57,386 --> 01:24:00,386
You are a good girl.

1429
01:24:07,386 --> 01:24:09,386
don't let me go.

1430
01:24:09,386 --> 01:24:12,386
don't let me go.

1431
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:19,386
Put it a little deeper.

1432
01:24:21,386 --> 01:24:25,386
You are eating with Manco.

1433
01:24:25,386 --> 01:24:29,386
You are a pervert.

1434
01:24:29,386 --> 01:24:32,386
You are a pervert.

1435
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:35,386
You are a pervert.

1436
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:38,386
You are a pervert.

1437
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:41,386
You are a pervert.

1438
01:24:42,386 --> 01:24:45,386
You can give it back to me.

1439
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:50,386
why are you trying to escape

1440
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:58,802
I do not know what you're talking about.

1441
01:25:03,802 --> 01:25:06,802
Who said you could let me go?

1442
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:09,802
Who said you could let me go?

1443
01:25:09,802 --> 01:25:12,802
I will do it.

1444
01:25:55,602 --> 01:25:57,602
sorry.

1445
01:25:57,602 --> 01:25:59,602
sorry.

1446
01:25:59,602 --> 01:26:01,602
How are you?

1447
01:26:03,602 --> 01:26:05,602
You look very comfortable.

1448
01:26:07,602 --> 01:26:09,602
Thanks.

1449
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:11,602
You make me feel good.

1450
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,602
No.

1451
01:26:15,602 --> 01:26:17,602
I can't drink it.

1452
01:26:21,602 --> 01:26:23,602
Did you smell it?

1453
01:26:23,602 --> 01:26:25,602
The smell in the room was nice.

1454
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:31,602
I'm tired.

1455
01:26:35,602 --> 01:26:37,602
I am also very comfortable.

1456
01:26:37,602 --> 01:26:39,602
did you like it?

1457
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:43,602
What's your job?

1458
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:47,602
What's your job?

1459
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,602
I can't take it anymore.

1460
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:51,602
you want it, don't you?

1461
01:26:51,602 --> 01:26:53,602
you want it, don't you?

1462
01:26:57,602 --> 01:26:59,602
It's very long.

1463
01:26:59,602 --> 01:27:01,602
You put it too much.

1464
01:27:03,602 --> 01:27:05,602
No.

1465
01:27:09,602 --> 01:27:11,602
open mouth.

1466
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:13,602
It smells good.

1467
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:15,602
Don't take it out.

1468
01:27:17,602 --> 01:27:19,602
I can't drink it.

1469
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:23,602
Whatâ€™s wrong with you?

1470
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:27,602
I told you to drink it.

1471
01:27:27,602 --> 01:27:29,602
Why?

1472
01:27:35,786 --> 01:27:38,018
too disgusting.

1473
01:27:38,018 --> 01:27:40,018
too disgusting.

1474
01:27:50,922 --> 01:27:52,922
You don't want this anymore, do you?

1475
01:27:53,922 --> 01:27:56,922
You want the real thing, don't you?

1476
01:27:57,922 --> 01:27:59,922
Come on, get up.

1477
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:02,922
You want the real thing now, don't you?

1478
01:28:02,922 --> 01:28:04,922
no I do not.

1479
01:28:05,922 --> 01:28:07,922
You see, you haven't done this before.

1480
01:28:07,922 --> 01:28:08,922
move.

1481
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:09,922
What?

1482
01:28:09,922 --> 01:28:10,922
move.

1483
01:28:10,922 --> 01:28:11,922
What?

1484
01:28:11,922 --> 01:28:13,922
no i'm fine.

1485
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:15,922
You can't do that.

1486
01:28:15,922 --> 01:28:18,922
You almost moved when I put you on the bed.

1487
01:28:18,922 --> 01:28:20,922
No, I don't want to.

1488
01:28:20,922 --> 01:28:21,922
hurry up.

1489
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:26,522
No, I don't want to.

1490
01:28:26,522 --> 01:28:27,522
move.

1491
01:28:27,522 --> 01:28:28,522
What?

1492
01:28:29,522 --> 01:28:32,522
If you don't move, the manager will get angry.

1493
01:28:32,522 --> 01:28:34,522
I can't move.

1494
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:35,522
Why?

1495
01:28:35,522 --> 01:28:36,522
did you get out of bed

1496
01:28:36,522 --> 01:28:37,522
Yes.

1497
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:38,522
because you feel good

1498
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,522
No.

1499
01:28:43,522 --> 01:28:44,522
stop.

1500
01:28:44,522 --> 01:28:46,522
stop.

1501
01:28:46,522 --> 01:28:48,522
I will watch you.

1502
01:28:51,522 --> 01:28:52,522
You have a mark.

1503
01:28:55,522 --> 01:28:56,522
look at me.

1504
01:29:02,522 --> 01:29:03,522
You look like a flying squirrel.

1505
01:29:03,522 --> 01:29:05,522
Come on, turn your face towards me.

1506
01:29:05,522 --> 01:29:06,522
yeah.

1507
01:29:06,522 --> 01:29:07,522

yeah.

1515
01:29:18,522 --> 01:29:23,522
Aika chased me with her tail.

1516
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:24,522
yeah.

1517
01:29:24,522 --> 01:29:26,522
You are the best.

1518
01:29:31,522 --> 01:29:32,522
No no no.

1519
01:30:04,938 --> 01:30:06,938

Kota

1523
01:30:21,898 --> 01:30:23,898
You lost to Kota?

1524
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:25,898
May I?

1525
01:30:32,034 --> 01:30:34,034
i hope you get a lot

1526
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,890
What are you doing?

1527
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:44,890
I will do it.

1528
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:46,890
You should go there and do it.

1529
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:48,890
stop.

1530
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,890

01:32:42,362 --> 01:32:44,362
who is crying

1578
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,362
who is crying

1579
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:57,050
how are you feeling

1580
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:59,050
how are you feeling

1581
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:01,050
You should admit it.

1582
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:05,050
Then, everyone does their best.

1583
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:09,050
You should admit it.

1584
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,050
look!

1585
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:13,050
You must feel good.

1586
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:17,050
Hey!

1587
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,050
Don't pretend to be innocent.

1588
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,050
You are a bitch.

1589
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,050
You are a bitch.

1590
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,050
Oh no!

1591
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:27,050
Oh no!

1592
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:29,050
Oh no!

1593
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:31,050
Oh no!

1594
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:33,050
Oh no!

1595
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:35,050
Oh no!

1596
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:37,050
Oh no!

1597
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:39,334
Oh no!

1598
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:44,042
I can't do this anymore.

1599
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:50,042
Too tight.

1600
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:54,042
I'm boring.

1601
01:33:58,042 --> 01:34:00,042
I can not do it.

1602
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:04,042
do it yourself.

1603
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:08,042
This is a headache.

1604
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:14,042
You can do it.

1605
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:28,042
I can not do it.

1606
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:32,042
I can not do it.

1607
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:34,042
I can not do it.

1608
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:42,042
too painful.

1609
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:44,042
it's in my mouth.

1610
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:48,042
look at me.

1611
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:52,042
I am alone.

1612
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:54,042
which one do you like more?

1613
01:34:56,042 --> 01:34:58,042
which one?

1614
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:00,042
which one?

1615
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:06,042
I have to call a doctor to do this.

1616
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:12,042
too difficult.

1617
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:14,042
It's so easy.

1618
01:35:24,402 --> 01:35:26,402
You start breathing heavily again.

1619
01:35:28,402 --> 01:35:30,402
which one do you like more?

1620
01:35:32,402 --> 01:35:34,402
you don't like it

1621
01:35:34,402 --> 01:35:36,402
Why?

1622
01:35:36,402 --> 01:35:38,402
you said.

1623
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:42,402
Let's ask him again.

1624
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:46,402
which one do you like more?

1625
01:35:46,402 --> 01:35:48,402
Is your boyfriend still ten sauce?

1626
01:35:48,402 --> 01:35:50,402
Ten sauces.

1627
01:35:54,778 --> 01:35:58,642
I did it!

1628
01:35:58,642 --> 01:35:59,642
how do you feel?

1629
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:01,642
Very good!

1630
01:36:01,642 --> 01:36:02,642
I feel great!

1631
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:04,642
I can not hear you.

1632
01:36:04,642 --> 01:36:06,642
I feel great!

1633
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:08,642
I am very happy.

1634
01:36:08,642 --> 01:36:09,642
I feel great!

1635
01:36:09,642 --> 01:36:13,410
no no no!

1636
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:16,410
it's coming!

1637
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:21,410
I'll put this in as well.

1638
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,410
Really?

1639
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,378
I got it.

1640
01:36:25,378 --> 01:36:26,378
no no no!

1641
01:36:26,378 --> 01:36:28,378
no no no!

1642
01:36:28,378 --> 01:36:30,378
it's coming!

1643
01:36:30,378 --> 01:36:33,338
Oh no!

1644
01:36:33,338 --> 01:36:35,338
no no no!

1645
01:36:39,338 --> 01:36:41,338
It is heavy.

1646
01:36:42,954 --> 01:36:46,114
it hurts.

1647
01:36:54,682 --> 01:36:56,682
It stinks!

1648
01:36:56,682 --> 01:36:58,682
What a waste!

1649
01:36:58,682 --> 01:37:00,682
it's all over.

1650
01:37:00,682 --> 01:37:04,682
It's too wasteful, so put it in.

1651
01:37:04,682 --> 01:37:06,682
It's a waste.

1652
01:37:08,682 --> 01:37:10,682
It's a waste.

1653
01:37:10,682 --> 01:37:12,682
I do not want.

1654
01:37:12,682 --> 01:37:14,682
I'll put it all in.

1655
01:37:20,682 --> 01:37:22,682
It's a mess.

1656
01:37:22,682 --> 01:37:24,682
It's a mess.

1657
01:37:24,682 --> 01:37:26,682
It's a mess.

1658
01:37:26,682 --> 01:37:28,682
It's a mess.

1659
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:30,682
You are a bitch.

1660
01:37:32,682 --> 01:37:36,546
It's a mess.

1661
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:44,090
I will put it in.

1662
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:47,090
You can put it in.

1663
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:49,090
I will put it in.

1664
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:51,174
No!

1665
01:38:10,714 --> 01:38:12,714
I will put it in.

1666
01:38:12,714 --> 01:38:14,714
have a look.

1667
01:38:14,714 --> 01:38:16,714
All white.

1668
01:38:16,714 --> 01:38:18,714
All wrinkled because of the manager.

1669
01:38:24,714 --> 01:38:26,714
are you happy?

1670
01:38:30,714 --> 01:38:32,714
are you happy?

1671
01:38:32,714 --> 01:38:34,714
look at this.

1672
01:38:34,714 --> 01:38:36,714
It's all crumpled, isn't it?

1673
01:38:36,714 --> 01:38:38,714
Yes.

1674
01:38:38,714 --> 01:38:40,714
God.

1675
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,714
God.

1676
01:38:44,714 --> 01:38:46,714
There are so many spiders.

1677
01:38:46,714 --> 01:38:48,714
so cool.

1678
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,714
All white.

1679
01:38:50,714 --> 01:38:52,714
All white.

1680
01:38:52,714 --> 01:38:56,714
This is a photo of a guy having sex with a sexy girl.

1681
01:38:58,714 --> 01:39:00,714
Take a good photo of it.

1682
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:09,314
All crumpled.

1683
01:39:11,314 --> 01:39:13,314
All white.

1684
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:15,314
All crumpled.

1685
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:19,314
I can't do this anymore.

1686
01:39:19,314 --> 01:39:21,314
what are you saying?

1687
01:39:21,314 --> 01:39:23,314
I can't do this anymore.

1688
01:39:23,314 --> 01:39:25,314
what happens?

1689
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:27,314
I want to take a look.

1690
01:39:27,314 --> 01:39:29,314
What will happen if I do more?

1691
01:39:31,314 --> 01:39:33,314
what happens?

1692
01:39:33,314 --> 01:39:35,314
I want to take a look.

1693
01:39:35,314 --> 01:39:37,314
I can not do it.

1694
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,410
I'm so happy.

1695
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,410
I'm so happy.

1696
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,410
Do you get weird?

1697
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:34,410
Move yourself.

1698
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:38,410
You can move, right?

1699
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:40,410
I'm so happy.

1700
01:40:45,634 --> 01:40:47,634
I heard that Aiko's drawings are very good.

1701
01:40:51,634 --> 01:40:53,634
I want to take a look.

1702
01:40:55,634 --> 01:40:57,634
I want to take a look.

1703
01:40:59,634 --> 01:41:01,634
is that so?

1704
01:41:01,634 --> 01:41:03,634
is that so?

1705
01:41:03,634 --> 01:41:05,634
Show me more.

1706
01:41:07,634 --> 01:41:09,634
Show me more.

1707
01:41:09,634 --> 01:41:11,634
I'm so happy.

1708
01:41:32,506 --> 01:41:34,506
how are you feeling

1709
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,506
how are you feeling

1710
01:41:36,506 --> 01:41:38,506
You can move more.

1711
01:41:40,506 --> 01:41:42,506
No no no.

1712
01:41:56,866 --> 01:41:58,866
You're going to be weird.

1713
01:41:58,866 --> 01:42:00,866
You're going to be weird.

1714
01:42:00,866 --> 01:42:02,866
You're going to be weird.

1715
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:04,866
You're going to be weird.

1716
01:42:04,866 --> 01:42:06,866
No no no.

1717
01:42:06,866 --> 01:42:08,866
I can't take it anymore.

1718
01:42:10,866 --> 01:42:12,866
where do you want to go

1719
01:42:12,866 --> 01:42:14,866
where do you want to go

1720
01:42:14,866 --> 01:42:16,866
tell me.

1721
01:42:20,866 --> 01:42:22,866
tell me.

1722
01:42:22,866 --> 01:42:24,866
Tell me where you want it.

1723
01:42:28,866 --> 01:42:30,866
where do you want to go

1724
01:42:30,866 --> 01:42:32,866
Come on and tell me.

1725
01:42:32,866 --> 01:42:34,866
Come on and tell me.

1726
01:42:34,866 --> 01:42:36,866
I can't take it anymore.

1727
01:42:36,866 --> 01:42:38,866
I can't take it anymore.

1728
01:42:38,866 --> 01:42:40,866
I can't take it anymore.

1729
01:42:40,866 --> 01:42:42,866
I can't take it anymore.

1730
01:42:42,866 --> 01:42:44,866
I can't take it anymore.

1731
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:23,070
I'm so glad you gave me so much.

1732
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:27,070
I'm so glad you gave me so much.

1733
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:31,070
I'm so glad you're back at the beach.

1734
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:36,070
Can you give me this much?

1735
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:38,070
I'm so full

1736
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:40,070
Oh no. You have given her so much.

1737
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:43,070
I'm so full

1738
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:46,070
I'm so full

1739
01:43:54,778 --> 01:43:56,778
You are so excited.

1740
01:43:57,778 --> 01:43:59,778
I'm going to pay for it.

1741
01:43:59,778 --> 01:44:00,778
marvelous.

1742
01:44:01,778 --> 01:44:02,778
That's fine.

1743
01:44:11,946 --> 01:44:13,946
Hey, the store is closed today.

1744
01:44:13,946 --> 01:44:14,946
let's go.

1745
01:44:14,946 --> 01:44:15,946
Really?

1746
01:44:15,946 --> 01:44:16,946
Isn't it bad?

1747
01:44:16,946 --> 01:44:17,946
Yes.

1748
01:44:17,946 --> 01:44:18,946
OK

1749
01:44:18,946 --> 01:44:19,946
I will do my best.

1750
01:44:20,946 --> 01:44:21,946
goodbye.

1751
01:44:21,946 --> 01:44:27,210
She is the best host.

1752
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:29,210
I don't think I can do this.

1753
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,210
I do not think so.

1754
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:35,210
You are very excited.

1755
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:37,210
I can not.

1756
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:46,210
I'm surprised you didn't make too much noise.

1757
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:47,210
You can hear it.

1758
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:53,210
you are a baby.

1759
01:45:02,074 --> 01:45:05,574
you are late! I'm finally here!

1760
01:45:05,574 --> 01:45:06,574
sorry!

1761
01:45:06,574 --> 01:45:07,574
What are you doing

1762
01:45:07,574 --> 01:45:09,574
I'm just going to pick up girls.

1763
01:45:11,574 --> 01:45:13,574
You are the worst!

1764
01:45:15,074 --> 01:45:19,074
My friend is here!

1765
01:45:20,574 --> 01:45:23,074
After the manager leaves, you feel alone.

1766
01:45:25,574 --> 01:45:26,574
it is true!

1767
01:45:27,574 --> 01:45:29,574
Super famous Internet celebrity!

1768
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,074
Did you notice?

1769
01:45:32,074 --> 01:45:33,074
I did it.

1770
01:45:33,074 --> 01:45:34,074
you are too fat!

1771
01:45:34,074 --> 01:45:35,074
Did you notice?

1772
01:45:35,074 --> 01:45:37,074
What's with that dress?

1773
01:45:37,074 --> 01:45:38,574
Let's get a little closer.

1774
01:45:38,574 --> 01:45:40,574
Let's toast!

1775
01:45:41,574 --> 01:45:43,574
take it.

1776
01:45:46,074 --> 01:45:48,074
For our wonderful gathering today!

1777
01:45:48,074 --> 01:45:49,074
Really?

1778
01:45:49,074 --> 01:45:51,074
Nice to meet you!

1779
01:45:52,074 --> 01:45:54,074
For our wonderful gathering today!

1780
01:45:54,074 --> 01:45:56,074
cheers!

1781
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:03,022
It's amazing!

1782
01:46:03,022 --> 01:46:06,022
Look at my Aika!

1783
01:46:06,022 --> 01:46:08,022
What?

1784
01:46:08,022 --> 01:46:10,022
You are not very friendly.

1785
01:46:10,022 --> 01:46:13,022
I will get more love from you.

1786
01:46:13,022 --> 01:46:15,022
so you should be nice to yourself

1787
01:46:15,022 --> 01:46:18,022
You can't say hello to me.

1788
01:46:20,022 --> 01:46:21,022
hair.

1789
01:46:21,022 --> 01:46:24,022
Do you want to see me perverted?

1790
01:46:26,022 --> 01:46:27,022
You want to see me, don't you?

1791
01:46:27,022 --> 01:46:28,022
I do!

1792
01:46:28,022 --> 01:46:30,022
Why are you showing me?

1793
01:46:30,022 --> 01:46:34,022
You are just jealous of me.

1794
01:46:34,022 --> 01:46:35,022
What?

1795
01:46:35,022 --> 01:46:39,022
I'm a successful soap opera actor.

1796
01:46:39,022 --> 01:46:41,022
You're still a soap opera actor.

1797
01:46:41,022 --> 01:46:43,022
what are you saying?

1798
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,022
You are crazy.

1799
01:46:45,022 --> 01:46:48,022
You are jealous of me.

1800
01:46:50,022 --> 01:46:54,022
You are crazy!

1801
01:46:54,022 --> 01:46:56,022
Is that all you want to say?

1802
01:46:57,022 --> 01:47:00,022
I'll show you my perverted side.

1803
01:47:02,022 --> 01:47:05,022
You're fine with that, right?

1804
01:47:05,022 --> 01:47:08,022
You are so driven.

1805
01:47:08,022 --> 01:47:09,022
What?

1806
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:11,022
Hey!

1807
01:47:11,022 --> 01:47:13,022
Hey!

1808
01:47:15,022 --> 01:47:17,022
Hey!

1809
01:47:20,022 --> 01:47:22,022
You are too aggressive.

1810
01:47:27,022 --> 01:47:30,022
do you want to see this

1811
01:47:30,022 --> 01:47:33,022
can you do it?

1812
01:47:44,382 --> 01:47:46,382
You are too aggressive.

1813
01:47:46,382 --> 01:47:48,382
My arm hurts.

1814
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:54,382
do you want to see this

1815
01:47:54,382 --> 01:47:56,382
feels good.

1816
01:47:56,382 --> 01:47:58,382
It's hot.

1817
01:47:58,382 --> 01:48:00,382
It's hot.

1818
01:48:08,382 --> 01:48:10,382
You are so erotic.

01:48:24,382 --> 01:48:26,382
I want to see your perverted side.

1821
01:48:26,382 --> 01:48:28,382
Really?

1822
01:48:36,382 --> 01:48:38,382
You are so erotic.

1823
01:48:43,382 --> 01:48:45,382
You are very different from before.

01:48:55,382 --> 01:48:57,382
you are so nice.

1825
01:48:57,382 --> 01:49:00,382
Do you like erotic people?

I will do it slowly.

1844
01:50:14,182 --> 01:50:16,182
Does it hurt?

1845
01:50:19,182 --> 01:50:21,182
the weather is too hot.

1846

It's not there.

1863
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:55,350
You can't do that yet.

1864
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,350
You can do this.

1865
01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:00,350

You are already in my face.

01:54:47,134 --> 01:54:50,134
You have a lot of acne.

1910
01:54:57,518 --> 01:54:59,518

It's hitting me in the throat.

1937
01:56:59,242 --> 01:57:01,242
Do you do it yourself?

1938
01:57:11,242 --> 01:57:13,242
feels good.

1939
01:57:29,242 --> 01:57:31,242

02:07:09,266 --> 02:07:12,266
Mao, did you cum again?

2063
02:07:16,562 --> 02:07:18,562
Mao Zedong will not come out.

2064
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:29,714
Do not do!

2065

02:23:54,574 --> 02:23:58,574
let me in.

2266
02:23:58,574 --> 02:24:00,574
let me in.

2267
02:24:01,574 --> 02:24:04,574
Why don't you let me in?

2268
02:24:05,574 --> 02:24:07,574
Do you not like it?

2269
02:24:07,574 --> 02:24:09,574
Do you not like it?

2270
02:24:09,574 --> 02:24:11,574
tell me to let you in.

2271
02:24:12,574 --> 02:24:14,574
tell me you want me.

2272
02:24:15,574 --> 02:24:17,574
Can't you say it?

2273
02:24:17,574 --> 02:24:19,574
I want you.

2274
02:24:19,574 --> 02:24:21,574
again.

2275
02:24:21,574 --> 02:24:23,574
you need me.

2276
02:24:41,574 --> 02:24:43,574
do you want me

2277
02:24:46,574 --> 02:24:48,574
come over.

2278
02:24:52,806 --> 02:24:54,806
feels good.

2279
02:24:54,806 --> 02:24:56,806
It feels good to be here.

2280
02:24:59,806 --> 02:25:01,806
You are so soft.

2281
02:25:01,806 --> 02:25:03,806
I knew it.

2282
02:25:08,806 --> 02:25:10,806
You are so soft.

2283
02:25:10,806 --> 02:25:12,806
Let's take a photo.

2284
02:25:12,806 --> 02:25:14,806
Let's take a photo.

2285
02:25:14,806 --> 02:25:16,806
Let's take a photo.

2286
02:25:22,806 --> 02:25:24,806
feels good.

2287
02:25:32,806 --> 02:25:34,806
I'm so good.

2288
02:25:38,806 --> 02:25:40,806
feels good.

2289
02:25:42,806 --> 02:25:44,806
It feels good to be here.

2290
02:25:45,806 --> 02:25:47,806
what should I do?

2291
02:26:07,874 --> 02:26:11,474
okokokok...

2292
02:26:12,474 --> 02:26:13,474
OK...

2293
02:26:13,474 --> 02:26:14,474
OK...

2294
02:26:18,474 --> 02:26:21,474
Why am I already rested?

2295
02:26:21,474 --> 02:26:24,474
what a waste...

2296
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:10,630
OMG!

2297
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:12,630
It is like a blue sky.

2298
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:14,630
OMG!

2299
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:16,630
OMG!

2300
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:18,630
I am so sleepy.

2301
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:20,630
Are you still sleepy?

2302
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:22,630
What's wrong?

2303
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:24,630
I'm going to sleep.

2304
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:28,630
Oh no!

2305
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:36,630
feels good.

2306
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:38,630
I am so sleepy.

2307
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:42,630
I'm glad you can use the phrase you used with Kanae.

2308
02:27:51,162 --> 02:27:58,162
Let me go! Let me go!

2309
02:28:23,274 --> 02:28:25,274
You have a lot of hair!

2310
02:28:25,274 --> 02:28:28,274
I'll give you a squeeze.

2311
02:28:30,274 --> 02:28:33,274
But you can't take it off, can you?

2312
02:28:33,274 --> 02:28:35,274
I want you to take it off.

2313
02:28:35,274 --> 02:28:37,274
please.

2314
02:28:40,274 --> 02:28:42,274
please!

2315
02:28:42,274 --> 02:28:43,274
please!

2316
02:28:43,274 --> 02:28:45,274
OMG!

2317
02:28:45,274 --> 02:28:47,274
I will take it off.

2318
02:28:47,274 --> 02:28:49,274
please!

2319
02:28:50,274 --> 02:28:51,274
I am very happy.

2320
02:28:51,274 --> 02:28:53,274
look at this.

2321
02:28:58,274 --> 02:29:00,274
You have a lot of hair.

2322
02:29:01,274 --> 02:29:03,274
You just took it off.

2323
02:29:12,274 --> 02:29:15,274
look at this.

2324
02:29:15,274 --> 02:29:17,274
Stinks.

2325
02:29:17,274 --> 02:29:19,274
What? Does it stink?

2326
02:29:19,274 --> 02:29:21,274
Do not say.

2327
02:29:21,274 --> 02:29:23,274
Stinks.

2328
02:29:23,274 --> 02:29:26,274
Are you in a bad mood?

2329
02:29:26,274 --> 02:29:28,274
I feel good.

2330
02:29:28,274 --> 02:29:31,274
You look embarrassed.

2331
02:29:31,274 --> 02:29:34,274
Don't you feel embarrassed to be looked at like this?

2332
02:29:35,274 --> 02:29:37,274
I am very happy.

2333
02:29:38,274 --> 02:29:40,274
I'll take it off too.

2334
02:29:41,274 --> 02:29:43,274
I will take it off again.

2335
02:29:43,274 --> 02:29:46,274
It is flying.

2336
02:29:48,274 --> 02:29:50,274
So funny.

2337
02:29:54,274 --> 02:29:59,746
I have hair all over my head.

2338
02:30:01,746 --> 02:30:03,746
How many times have you taken it off?

2339
02:30:03,746 --> 02:30:05,746
I know.

2340
02:30:05,746 --> 02:30:07,746
Why are you still in a bad mood?

2341
02:30:07,746 --> 02:30:09,746
You really interesting.

2342
02:30:15,746 --> 02:30:18,746
I can't take it off yet.

2343
02:30:20,746 --> 02:30:24,746
You're still in a bad mood, aren't you?

2344
02:30:24,746 --> 02:30:26,746
I can't take it off.

2345
02:30:26,746 --> 02:30:28,746
I can't take it off.

2346
02:30:28,746 --> 02:30:30,746
I can't take it off.

2347
02:30:30,746 --> 02:30:32,746
OMG!

2348
02:30:35,746 --> 02:30:37,746
OMG!

2349
02:30:38,746 --> 02:30:45,706
I can't believe I can love you.

2350
02:30:51,706 --> 02:30:53,706
I feel good.

2351
02:30:55,706 --> 02:30:58,706
I am such a woman.

2352
02:30:59,706 --> 02:31:01,706
can you give me this

2353
02:31:03,706 --> 02:31:05,706
I can not.

2354
02:31:08,706 --> 02:31:10,706
I can not.

2355
02:31:10,706 --> 02:31:12,706
help me.

2356
02:31:12,706 --> 02:31:15,906
give it to me.

2357
02:31:15,906 --> 02:31:17,906
I will hand it over to you.

2358
02:31:21,906 --> 02:31:23,906
I can not.

2359
02:31:31,906 --> 02:31:33,906
I feel good.

2360
02:31:44,906 --> 02:31:46,906
I am such a woman.

2361
02:31:48,946 --> 02:31:50,946
help me.

2362
02:31:51,946 --> 02:31:53,946
I can not.

2363
02:32:10,778 --> 02:32:13,778
i really want to take it off

2364
02:32:13,778 --> 02:32:15,778
You are a pervert.

2365
02:32:15,778 --> 02:32:17,778
I can not.

2366
02:32:17,778 --> 02:32:19,778
stop.

2367
02:32:20,778 --> 02:32:23,778
I can't take it off.

2368
02:32:25,778 --> 02:32:27,778
It is bitter.

2369
02:32:27,778 --> 02:32:29,778
I can't take it off.

2370
02:32:30,778 --> 02:32:33,778
My boyfriend is a pervert.

2371
02:32:43,778 --> 02:32:45,778
I can not.

2372
02:32:45,778 --> 02:32:50,778
There are many things about me.

2373
02:33:24,354 --> 02:33:29,354
You are such a jerk.

2374
02:33:29,354 --> 02:33:34,354
You are a psychopath.

2375
02:33:34,354 --> 02:33:39,354
But you are with me.

2376
02:33:39,354 --> 02:33:44,586
So, stay tuned for the next one.

2377
02:33:44,586 --> 02:33:49,586
What?

2378
02:33:49,586 --> 02:33:54,586
I will prepare a lot.

2379
02:33:54,586 --> 02:33:59,586
what are you saying?
