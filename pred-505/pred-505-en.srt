1
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,970
I'm going to drink champagne.

2
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,970
Isn't it good?

3
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,970
I'll put this in.

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,970
It looks delicious.

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,970
It looks really good.

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,970
Cheers!

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,970
Let's eat.

8
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:42,994
It's good.

9
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:44,994
I'm going to eat.

10
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:46,994
What is it?

11
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:48,994
Is it a present?

12
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,994
I'm so happy.

13
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,994
Thank you.

14
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,994
Chocolate?

15
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:58,994
It looks delicious.

16
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:00,994
What is this?

17
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,994
It's cute.

18
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:05,994
Thank you.

19
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,994
I'm glad.

20
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:09,994
I'm embarrassed.

21
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:11,994
I'm embarrassed.

22
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,994
I'm embarrassed to be with a ghost.

23
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:15,994
That's not true.

24
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,994
It's amazing.

25
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,994
It's very cute.

26
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,994
It's cute.

27
00:01:21,994 --> 00:01:23,994
Is this a brand?

28
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,994
I've seen it before.

29
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,994
It's a very expensive one.

30
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:29,994
Did you buy it?

31
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:31,994
I got this as a present.

32
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:33,994
I'm her boyfriend.

33
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,994
I have a boyfriend.

34
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,994
I see.

35
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:39,994
He's kind to me.

36
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,994
He's a very expensive person.

37
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:43,994
He's a venture capitalist.

38
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,994
A venture capitalist?

39
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:49,994
Is he a company?

40
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,994
He's a company.

41
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,994
He's the president.

42
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:55,994
He's amazing.

43
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,946
Cheers!

44
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:08,426
Cheers!

45
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,426
It's good.

46
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,426
I'm happy to have a drink in the afternoon.

47
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:15,426
Why do you drink light bar in the afternoon?

48
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:19,426
I have something to talk about.

49
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,426
Oh, you brought the camera.

50
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,426
I brought it.

51
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:24,426
It was heavy.

52
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:25,426
Sorry.

53
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:27,426
It seems to be recording.

54
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,426
Is it recording?

55
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,426
Is it recording?

56
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,426
Yes.

57
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,426
I got watered by customers.

58
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:28,426
I heard that I'm a famous influencer now.

59
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,426
I met this person the other day.

60
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:33,426
Look at this.

61
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:36,626
Look.

62
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:41,626
It looks delicious.

63
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:42,626
Where is this?

64
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:48,626
I went to a restaurant in a luxury hotel from Matterma.

65
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:51,626
I've been taking pictures all the time.

66
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,626
It's different.

67
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,626
It's so fancy.

68
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,626
It was more plain before.

69
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,626
This is a port girl.

70
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:03,626
Yes.

71
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,626
I don't know because I'm fat.

72
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:09,626
I'm touching my phone all the time.

73
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:12,626
How many likes did you get?

74
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:15,666
I don't know.

75
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,882
130,000 people.

76
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:19,882
Did you hear that?

77
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:20,882
What?

78
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:21,882
130,000 people.

79
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,882
It's funny.

80
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:29,882
Aika is like this now.

81
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:33,882
We talked about the soap.

82
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:37,882
She hated it at once.

83
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,882
I think that's in the video.

84
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,882
Look at this.

85
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,882
I met the manager.

86
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:46,882
I met the manager.

87
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,882
I went to a restaurant recently.

88
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,882
I met Aika.

89
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,882
I said I wanted to go there.

90
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:59,882
Do you remember the izakaya near the restaurant?

91
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,882
It was a little old.

92
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,882
Did you see her face?

93
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,882
She said she didn't want to talk anymore.

94
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:10,882
Let's go there.

95
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:11,882
It's a good timing.

96
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:12,882
It's a good timing.

97
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:18,882
Do you remember the waiting room where Aika was?

98
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:21,882
I decorated the waiting room.

99
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,882
There was no girl in the waiting room.

100
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,882
You're laughing at me.

101
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:31,882
I'm not laughing at you.

102
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:34,882
I'm laughing at you.

103
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,882
It's fun to drink with everyone.

104
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,394
I'm like that.

105
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:48,394
I don't want to talk about the old days.

106
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:53,394
I'm still doing it.

107
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,394
I feel like I've been denied.

108
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,394
I'm sad.

109
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:01,810
I'm angry.

110
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,810
I'm a little angry.

111
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,810
But the world we live in is different.

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,810
What is she doing?

113
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,810
She has a younger manager boyfriend.

114
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,810
She doesn't have money.

115
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,810
She eats and drinks well.

116
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,810
I envy her.

117
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,002
I'm angry.

118
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:31,002
I'm thinking about something.

119
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,002
What is it?

120
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:41,098
I'm thinking of raping Aika.

121
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,354
Rape?

122
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,354
I don't understand.

123
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,354
I'm angry.

124
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:57,354
I'm thinking of raping Aika.

125
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:02,354
I'm afraid of making my old friends angry.

126
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,354
You want to see it, too.

127
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,354
I'm going to hell.

128
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,474
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,474
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:18,474
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,474
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,474
You are amazing.

133
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,474
You look happy.

134
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,474
You look happy.

135
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,474
Let's go.

136
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,438
Let's go.

137
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,010
I'm going.

138
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,418
I'm back.

139
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,418
Welcome back.

140
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:47,306
What did you do?

141
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,826
You are back.

142
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,826
Congratulations.

143
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,826
What is this?

144
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,826
Congratulations.

145
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,826
I was gone.

146
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,826
I was waiting for you.

147
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,390
Congratulations.

148
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:11,258
Happy birthday to you

149
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:15,258
Happy birthday to you

150
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:20,258
Happy birthday dear Aikawa

151
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:25,258
Happy birthday to you

152
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:27,258
I did it!

153
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,258
Do it again!

154
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,258
I'll go

155
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:34,258
Congratulations! Thank you!

156
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,258
I'm so happy!

157
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:42,258
Thank you!

158
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:46,258
Aikawa, you must be tired from all the work you did today

159
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:50,258
I'm so happy! I'm so tired

160
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,258
I thought you'd be fine

161
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,258
I'm so happy!

162
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:56,258
I'll do my best

163
00:08:56,258 --> 00:09:05,258
Let's do our best!

164
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,258
Let's do our best!

165
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,258
Let's do our best!

166
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:15,258
By the way, tomorrow we'll be back early

167
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:17,258
Really?

168
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:20,258
Don't drink until then!

169
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,258
I'll be drunk

170
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:37,442
We used to make money by using our bodies.

171
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:42,442
But now, I don't want to talk about that at all.

172
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,442
People change.

173
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,442
I'm afraid of the rent.

174
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,442
I'm going to buy it soon. Wait.

175
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:58,018
I'll make a phone call.

176
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:01,018
I'm calling my boss.

177
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,010
Did you get a call?

178
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,010
Yes.

179
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,010
Show me.

180
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,010
I'm not here.

181
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,010
This is his house.

182
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,010
This is very spacious.

183
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
This is very spacious.

184
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,010
This is a good house.

185
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,010
It's different to make money.

186
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,010
This is amazing.

187
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,010
Did you put the camera in?

188
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,010
I put the camera in.

189
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,010
Is this okay?

190
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,010
I'm glad.

191
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,010
I did what I said.

192
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,010
But is this really okay?

193
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,010
Are you scared?

194
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,010
Don't be scared of the rent.

195
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,010
I'll take all the responsibility.

196
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,010
You just have to pay the rent.

197
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,010
You were aiming for the rent.

198
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,010
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,010
Wait.

200
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,010
I told you I had a magazine shoot today.

201
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,010
I'll be back soon.

202
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,010
Do it right.

203
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,010
I'll ask you.

204
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,010
You can make friends with me as an option.

205
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,010
I asked you.

206
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,010
See you.

207
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
Good luck.

208
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,010
Bye.

209
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,010
You are the manager.

210
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,010
I asked you to go to Aikanji first.

211
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,010
I have a meeting with a girl today.

212
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,010
I got the key.

213
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,010
I gave it to the manager.

214
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,010
Did you understand?

215
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,010
I'm scared.

216
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,010
I'm looking forward to it.

217
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,010
You are so mean to make me rape the manager.

218
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,010
Mean?

219
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,010
You'll be more relieved to know me.

220
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,010
I'm looking forward to it.

221
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,010
Cheers.

222
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,562
What?

223
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:29,762
What?

224
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,762
Aika-chan, long time no see.

225
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:36,506
You look so young.

226
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,506
Do I?

227
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,506
Yes.

228
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,610
You look so young.

229
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,578
How did you get in?

230
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,650
What?

231
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,650
I came in.

232
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,738
Wait!

233
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:57,738
Let me go!

234
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,738
What?

235
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,738
Stop!

236
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:06,290
Stop!

237
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,290
Wait!

238
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,290
What?

239
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,002
Don't touch me!

240
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:30,538
Stop!

241
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,658
No! No! No!

242
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,910
No!

243
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:22,002
Stop it!

244
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,618
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:34,618
Are you sad?

246
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:37,618
I'm a little sick.

247
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:41,618
I'm very sad.

248
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,618
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,618
Go home.

250
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:52,818
Are you sad?

251
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,658
Let me go.

252
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,786
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:06,786
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:11,066
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,066
Go home.

256
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,066
Go home.

257
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,066
Are you okay?

258
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,066
You are noisy.

259
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,306
Yeah!

260
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,802
Oh, no!

261
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:15,842
I don't want to do this anymore.

262
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,842
You're a good girl.

263
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,842
You're a good girl.

264
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:26,418
You're living a good life.

265
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,418
No!

266
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,978
Oh, no!

267
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,978
Stop it!

268
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,202
I said it's not a scratch.

269
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,202
I said it's a scratch.

270
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:29,202
It's amazing.

271
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,850
Can't you hear anything?

272
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,850
This apartment is really nice.

273
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,850
You live in a nice place.

274
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,530
I'll call and ask what's going on.

275
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:09,194
Wait a minute.

276
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,938
I'm in pain.

277
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,938
You look very painful.

278
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:32,778
You are in a big trouble.

279
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,234
Are you okay?

280
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:40,074
I want you to cry.

281
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:46,074
I'll go to the hospital.

282
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:48,074
Wait for me.

283
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,074
Did you see that?

284
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:56,074
I'll go to the hospital.

285
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,074
Go.

286
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:03,074
I don't want to go to the hospital.

287
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:35,426
No!

288
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,426
What's wrong?

289
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,426
No!

290
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:44,154
What is this place?

291
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:46,154
It's amazing!

292
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:50,994
Shut up!

293
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,706
Mao-san!

294
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:03,706
What's going on?

295
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:05,706
What's wrong?

296
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,706
Mao-san!

297
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,706
I think you're going to be in trouble!

298
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,706
Mao-san, help me!

299
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:15,706
Let me go!

300
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,706
What are you going to do if you get caught?

301
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,706
What was it?

302
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:21,706
What is this?

303
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:23,706
What are you doing?

304
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,706
Hey!

305
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:27,706
Let's record it.

306
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,706
We're going to make a memory.

307
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:31,706
Hey!

308
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,706
Mao-san!

309
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:35,706
Why?

310
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:37,706
I have to record this.

311
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:39,706
Don't take it.

312
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,706
I'm in trouble.

313
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,706
I'm in trouble.

314
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,706
Stop it!

315
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:47,706
You're a bitch!

316
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,706
Mao-san, why are you recording?

317
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,706
This is also a bitch.

318
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,706
Stop it!

319
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:55,706
You look good.

320
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:57,706
You look the same as when you were a professional.

321
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,706
You're a bitch.

322
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:03,706
Show me your face.

323
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,706
Take a good picture of my face.

324
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:11,706
Do you remember when you were working?

325
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,706
You're getting too carried away.

326
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:19,706
I'll give you more.

327
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,706
Stop it!

328
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,706
What are you doing?

329
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:25,706
What are you doing?

330
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,194
Stop it!

331
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,194
Are you embarrassed?

332
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,194
Don't take it.

333
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,194
You've been showing your manko to so many people.

334
00:21:40,194 --> 00:21:42,266
Stop it!

335
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,266
Stop it!

336
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,266
Mao-san is the number one manko in Soap.

337
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,266
You're the number one manko in Soap.

338
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,266
Stop it!

339
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,266
How do you feel?

340
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,266
I feel good.

341
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,266
Stop it!

342
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,266
What's this?

343
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,266
Do you feel it?

344
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,266
You're crazy.

345
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,266
Do you feel it?

346
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:14,266
You're a bitch.

347
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,266
You're a bitch.

348
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,266
Stop it!

349
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:20,266
Stop it!

350
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,882
You're bleeding.

351
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:24,882
Mao-san!

352
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,882
Do you feel good?

353
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:28,882
Do you feel good?

354
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,146
Stop it!

355
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:33,146
Why are you doing this?

356
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,146
Do you feel good because I don't answer?

357
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,146
I'm asking you if you feel good or not.

358
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:39,146
I don't feel good.

359
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:41,146
You're lying.

360
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:43,146
You're lying.

361
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,146
I don't want to do it anymore.

362
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,146
You feel it, don't you?

363
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,146
You don't feel it, do you?

364
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,146
I don't feel it.

365
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,146
What do you think of this face?

366
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:55,146
You feel it, don't you?

367
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,146
I really feel it.

368
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,146
Do you feel it?

369
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,146
Do you feel it?

370
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,146
Stop it!

371
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,146
You're a bitch.

372
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:11,146
What do you think of this?

373
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:15,146
What was it?

374
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:17,146
Do you still want to date Aika?

375
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,146
Do you still want to date Aika?

376
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:21,146
What do you think of this?

377
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,146
Don't show me.

378
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:25,146
Don't show me.

379
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:27,146
Don't show me.

380
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,146
I'll show you.

381
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:33,146
You're cute.

382
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,146
Where are you going?

383
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:39,146
Wait.

384
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:41,146
I'm scared.

385
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:43,146
I'm scared.

386
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:45,146
I'm scared.

387
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:47,146
Don't be crazy.

388
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:49,146
You're too crazy.

389
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,146
Don't be crazy.

390
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:55,146
Don't be crazy.

391
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,146
Are you okay?

392
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,146
Did you get a cold?

393
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:07,146
Did you forget that you're a girl?

394
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:11,146
You got a lot of love from me, didn't you?

395
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,146
I'm going to make you cute again today.

396
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,146
Manager

397
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:21,146
Stop it.

398
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,146
Let go of me.

399
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,146
It's noisy.

400
00:24:29,146 --> 00:24:31,146
It's a nuisance to your neighborhood.

401
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:37,146
What if you make such a loud voice and come to your neighborhood?

402
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:39,146
What are you going to do?

403
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,146
You'll be in trouble if you're seen.

404
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,146
Do you know that I'm a cleaning lady?

405
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:51,146
If you make a noise, I don't know what to do.

406
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,146
Do you understand?

407
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:59,146
Feel it.

408
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:01,146
Stop it.

409
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,146
Stop it.

410
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:05,146
Stop it.

411
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:07,146
Stop it.

412
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:11,146
It's noisy.

413
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,146
I'm sorry.

414
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:27,146
I'm glad I was a good girl.

415
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:29,146
I'm glad I was a good girl.

416
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,146
It's nice to have a lot of cute kids.

417
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:37,146
I'm glad I was a good girl.

418
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:43,146
Stop it.

419
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:45,146
Don't you want to be seen?

420
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,146
I'll hide your face.

421
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:51,146
Stop it.

422
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,146
You can't see my face, can you?

423
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:01,146
Do you want to feel good?

424
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,146
I'm cold.

425
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:13,146
You're wet.

426
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:15,146
You're wet.

427
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,146
You're wet.

428
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:19,146
You're wet.

429
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,146
You're not satisfied with your boyfriend's penis, are you?

430
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,146
You're a bitch.

431
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,146
You're not satisfied with your boyfriend's penis, are you?

432
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:29,146
What do you think?

433
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,146
Stop it.

434
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:33,146
I won't stop.

435
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:39,146
Wait.

436
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:41,146
Did you say it?

437
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:43,146
I didn't say it.

438
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:45,146
Did you say it?

439
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,146
I didn't say it.

440
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:51,146
Then, I'll make you do it.

441
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,146
I didn't say it.

442
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,146
I'll make you do it more.

443
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:01,146
You don't have enough love.

444
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:05,146
Do you feel good?

445
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,146
Do you feel good?

446
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:11,146
What's wrong with your face?

447
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,146
You look like you're looking down on me.

448
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:17,146
You're annoying.

449
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:19,146
I know.

450
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,146
You're annoying.

451
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:25,146
You should stop it.

452
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,146
You're not supposed to do it.

453
00:27:33,146 --> 00:27:35,146
You're a bitch.

454
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,146
You're a bitch.

455
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:39,146
You're a bitch.

456
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:44,018
You bite me.

457
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:48,018
You bite me.

458
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,018
Apologize to me.

459
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:52,018
Take off your legs.

460
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,018
I don't want to.

461
00:27:54,018 --> 00:27:56,018
Why do I have to take off my legs?

462
00:27:56,018 --> 00:27:58,018
Your legs look good on you.

463
00:28:00,018 --> 00:28:02,018
You look good with such a gorgeous underwear.

464
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:06,018
You're a bitch.

465
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:10,018
You're a bitch.

466
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,018
You're a bitch.

467
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:14,018
You're a bitch.

468
00:28:18,018 --> 00:28:20,018
You're used to it.

469
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:26,018
Go away.

470
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:28,018
Go away.

471
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:30,018
I don't want to.

472
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:32,018
I'm going to sleep.

473
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:34,018
I'm going to sleep.

474
00:28:34,018 --> 00:28:36,018
I'm going to sleep.

475
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,018
I'm going to sleep.

476
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:40,746
You should be more obedient to her.

477
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:41,746
No!

478
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,746
Do you think you're a man?

479
00:29:45,746 --> 00:29:49,746
You're going to be angry if you're the same woman.

480
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,746
You're not good enough.

481
00:29:54,746 --> 00:29:56,746
Stop it!

482
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:57,746
Don't touch me!

483
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:03,746
You still have a beautiful face.

484
00:30:03,746 --> 00:30:04,746
Stop it!

485
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:07,746
You seduced me with your body.

486
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:08,746
Turn around.

487
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:11,746
Stop it!

488
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:18,642
What's wrong?

489
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,642
Why are you so excited?

490
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:22,642
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:22,642 --> 00:30:24,642
Turn around.

492
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:29,642
Where are you going?

493
00:30:29,642 --> 00:30:30,642
No!

494
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:37,642
Where are you going?

495
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:38,642
Go home!

496
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:40,642
Do you think you can run away?

497
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:46,642
Stop it!

498
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:49,642
Why are you trying to run away?

499
00:30:49,642 --> 00:30:53,642
If you run away, this video will be spread.

500
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:58,642
When 1.3 million people watch this video, let's take a picture together.

501
00:30:58,642 --> 00:30:59,642
No!

502
00:30:59,642 --> 00:31:02,642
Let's show this to 1.3 million people.

503
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:06,642
I think we can get more followers.

504
00:31:06,642 --> 00:31:09,642
You're more beautiful.

505
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:13,642
No!

506
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:18,642
You're so cute.

507
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:22,642
You look good in that face.

508
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,642
Let's show it to them.

509
00:31:24,642 --> 00:31:27,642
No!

510
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:36,242
Why are you so excited?

511
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,242
No!

512
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:41,242
You're pretending to go again.

513
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:45,242
You're a liar.

514
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:46,242
No!

515
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:48,242
You're pretending to go again.

516
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,242
It's not over yet.

517
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,242
Okay?

518
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,242
Let's stop it.

519
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:54,242
Stop it.

520
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:56,242
Hey!

521
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:58,242
No!

522
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,242
You're noisy.

523
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:07,242
You're noisy.

524
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:09,242
Open your mouth.

525
00:32:09,242 --> 00:32:11,242
Open it.

526
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:15,242
Don't bite me.

527
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:17,242
You were bitten.

528
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:21,242
That's why you were making that voice.

529
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,242
Do you know what will happen if you bite me?

530
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:33,242
1.3 million people may watch this video.

531
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:45,242
Bite me more.

532
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:48,242
You're so naive.

533
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:50,242
Bite me more.

534
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:53,242
Bite me more.

535
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:54,242
Can you bite me?

536
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:56,242
Go deeper.

537
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,242
Go deeper.

538
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,242
Look at me.

539
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,242
Look at me.

540
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:11,242
Look at me.

541
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,242
Look at me.

542
00:33:16,242 --> 00:33:18,242
You're so wet.

543
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:21,242
Is it painful?

544
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:26,242
It's not over yet.

545
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:30,242
Why are you trying to end it?

546
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,242
It's not over yet.

547
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:40,242
It's not over yet.

548
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,242
You're noisy.

549
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:47,242
Do you feel good?

550
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,242
I feel good.

551
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:51,242
You're making a weird face.

552
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:58,282
You're so naughty.

553
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:01,282
You wanted to run away, didn't you?

554
00:34:02,282 --> 00:34:03,282
Did you wait for me?

555
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:17,498
What is this?

556
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,498
I've never seen such a thing.

557
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:25,306
You look terrible.

558
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,306
Look at you.

559
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:32,306
Is this OK?

560
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,306
Don't push me.

561
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:39,306
I can push you.

562
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:41,306
No.

563
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,306
You look terrible.

564
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,306
Look at you.

565
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:50,306
I've never seen such a thing.

566
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,306
Stop it.

567
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,306
I'm done.

568
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,306
You want to run away, don't you?

569
00:34:57,306 --> 00:35:00,306
Where can you run away?

570
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:02,306
Stop it.

571
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:18,858
You'll get hurt if you get angry at me.

572
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:20,858
I'm fine.

573
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:22,858
I'm fine.

574
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:24,858
I'm fine.

575
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:29,282
Stop it!

576
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:32,282
Is Aika's mic closed?

577
00:35:32,282 --> 00:35:34,282
I think so.

578
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:38,282
The manager said he wanted a baby.

579
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:41,282
I'll call him for you.

580
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:43,282
I'll call him for you.

581
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:45,282
Stop it!

582
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:50,282
You have money, so you can raise two children.

583
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,282
I don't want to do that!

584
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:58,282
If you close the mic, the manager will cry.

585
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:02,282
Stop it!

586
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:05,282
I don't want to do that!

587
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:08,282
You are very desperate.

588
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:11,282
You are holding your head up.

589
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,282
Look at Aika.

590
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,282
You are holding your head up.

591
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:18,282
You are feeling it.

592
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,282
You are feeling it with your head.

593
00:36:20,282 --> 00:36:22,282
I don't want to do that.

594
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:26,282
You are holding your head up.

595
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:29,282
You can feel it with your head.

596
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:31,282
You can feel it, right?

597
00:36:31,282 --> 00:36:33,282
No.

598
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:35,282
No.

599
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:40,282
I don't want to do that.

600
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,282
I don't want to do that.

601
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:45,282
You are holding your head up.

602
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:48,282
Can you feel it?

603
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:51,282
I'll give you a shock.

604
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:53,282
Yay!

605
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:59,282
Aika's pussy and the manager's penis are together.

606
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:02,282
Look at this.

607
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:05,282
You can see the hole in the butt.

608
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:07,282
Stop it!

609
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:10,282
This is the hole in the butt of a famous person.

610
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:13,282
You are shaking.

611
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:16,282
Stop it!

612
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:20,282
You smell like a woman.

613
00:37:20,282 --> 00:37:23,290
Stop it!

614
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,290
Stop it!

615
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,290
Stop it!

616
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,290
Turn around.

617
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,290
You are kissing.

618
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,290
Open your mouth.

619
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,290
Open your mouth.

620
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,290
You are kissing.

621
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,290
This is a silent attack.

622
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,290
You are gross.

623
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,290
You are gross.

624
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,290
You are gross.

625
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,290
You are gross.

626
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,290
You are gross.

627
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,290
You are gross.

628
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,290
Stop it!

629
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:22,858
Why?

630
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:26,858
Your back is shaking.

631
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:28,858
Are you sure?

632
00:38:29,858 --> 00:38:30,858
You are lying, aren't you?

633
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:32,858
You are lying.

634
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:34,858
You are lying again.

635
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,858
You are not energetic enough.

636
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:42,858
You are not energetic enough.

637
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:45,858
Where are you going?

638
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,858
No!

639
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:55,858
Let me go home.

640
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:57,858
You are lying.

641
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:00,858
You are lying.

642
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:02,858
No!

643
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:04,858
No!

644
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:06,858
What are you going to do?

645
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:08,858
I can't.

646
00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:10,858
I can't.

647
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,858
Do you want to go back to your colleagues?

648
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:18,858
Let's work together again.

649
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:19,858
I can't.

650
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,858
What are you going to do?

651
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:24,858
What are you going to do?

652
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:27,858
What are you going to do?

653
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:29,858
I can't.

654
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:32,858
You are annoying.

655
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:35,858
Let me touch you more.

656
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:37,858
Let me touch you more.

657
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:39,858
I'll eat you.

658
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:41,858
Stop it.

659
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:43,858
You are lying.

660
00:39:46,538 --> 00:39:48,538
Your back is shaking.

661
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:01,682
How do you like this present?

662
00:40:02,682 --> 00:40:03,682
Do you like it?

663
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:05,682
I'm tired.

664
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:07,682
Let me see.

665
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:09,682
Mom.

666
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,682
Tell me you are going to go.

667
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:14,682
I don't understand.

668
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:18,682
Will you stop me if I go?

669
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:21,682
I'll think about it.

670
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:23,682
Go ahead.

671
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:25,682
Go.

672
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:27,682
Go.

673
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:30,682
You can't even breathe as a woman.

674
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,682
I'll go.

675
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:34,682
I'll go.

676
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:39,682
Do you think this is true?

677
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:42,682
It's a lie.

678
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:44,682
Don't lie.

679
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,746
I'm a woman.

680
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:50,746
Stop it.

681
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,746
I'm glad you can't break it.

682
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:55,746
It's wet.

683
00:40:58,746 --> 00:40:59,746
Stop it.

684
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,746
Do you get wet when you dance?

685
00:41:02,746 --> 00:41:03,746
No?

686
00:41:04,746 --> 00:41:05,746
You like me.

687
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:07,746
You like me.

688
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:09,746
I'm glad.

689
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:11,746
Tell me.

690
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,746
You like me more than your boyfriend.

691
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:16,746
I've never liked you.

692
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:18,746
What are you talking about?

693
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:21,746
I can't.

694
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,746
I can't.

695
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:27,010
Stop it.

696
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,010
Stop it.

697
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,010
I'm glad you feel better.

698
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,010
You feel better, don't you?

699
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,010
I'm glad.

700
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,010
You are lucky.

701
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,010
I'm glad.

702
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,010
You said you would go when I go.

703
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,010
I'll go.

704
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,010
Go.

705
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,010
I'll go.

706
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,010
I'll go.

707
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,530
Don't stop me.

708
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,530
I'll go.

709
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,530
Don't stop me.

710
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,530
Don't stop me.

711
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,530
I'll go.

712
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,530
I'll go.

713
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,530
I'll go.

714
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,530
I'll be glad if you go.

715
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,530
I'll go.

716
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,530
Stop it.

717
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,530
Stop it.

718
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:27,462
Stop it!

719
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:32,042
I'm still young.

720
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:36,194
You...

721
00:42:36,194 --> 00:42:38,194
You...

722
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:40,194
Don't move.

723
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:44,194
You look like you like it the most.

724
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,194
You can do it.

725
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:48,194
You can do it.

726
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,194
Stop it.

727
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:52,194
Stop it.

728
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,194
Is it OK?

729
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,194
Is it OK?

730
00:42:58,194 --> 00:43:00,194
Is it OK?

731
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:04,194
You said you like to be pushed from behind.

732
00:43:06,194 --> 00:43:10,194
You said you like to be pushed from behind.

733
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:12,194
You are a bitch.

734
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,194
You are still young.

735
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:22,194
You said you wanted to go.

736
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:26,970
I don't know what you are talking about.

737
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,970
I can't hear you.

738
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,170
You are a bitch.

739
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,966
You are a bitch.

740
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:37,994
Oh, my God!

741
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:39,994
Oh, my God!

742
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,890
Oh, my God!

743
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,890
Oh, my God!

744
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,954
Oh, my God!

745
00:43:48,954 --> 00:43:51,890
Oh, my God!

746
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,890
Oh, my God!

747
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,890
Oh, my God!

748
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,890
Oh, my God!

749
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,890
Oh, my God!

750
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,890
Oh, my God!

751
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,890
Oh, my God!

752
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,890
Oh, my God!

753
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,890
Oh, my God!

754
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,442
That's enough!

755
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,210
I don't think so.

756
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,210
You can enjoy it a lot.

757
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,210
She hasn't enjoyed it yet.

758
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,210
You should close the door more.

759
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,210
What?

760
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,210
Did you close the door too much?

761
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,210
I told you.

762
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,210
I told you it's over.

763
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,210
You didn't.

764
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,210
I told you.

765
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,210
You didn't.

766
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,210
You lied to me.

767
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,210
I didn't.

768
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,210
You haven't closed the door yet.

769
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,210
Do you want to close the door more?

770
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,210
I want you to enjoy it more.

771
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,210
I don't want to.

772
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,210
Do you want to go to the bathroom again?

773
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,210
I don't want to.

774
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,210
Did you enjoy it so much?

775
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,210
Do you want to go to the bathroom again?

776
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,210
I'll help you.

777
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:38,210
Stop it!

778
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,402
Don't stop me!

779
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:49,902
Hey, manager, come with me!

780
00:45:49,902 --> 00:45:50,902
Ah, no!

781
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:54,402
I'm so tired when I'm running, I'm like...

782
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:57,402
I'm so scared, I'm going to lose my mind!

783
00:46:00,402 --> 00:46:01,902
What's wrong?

784
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:04,902
What's wrong?

785
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:06,402
Are you going to run away again?

786
00:46:06,402 --> 00:46:08,402
With your manager's dick?

787
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:11,902
Look at that and tell me.

788
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:14,902
Look at this.

789
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,402
I can't say it!

790
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:19,902
I told you it wouldn't end if you didn't say it.

791
00:46:21,902 --> 00:46:22,902
Hikaru...

792
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:23,902
Whose?

793
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:27,402
Whose dick?

794
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,902
Manager's...

795
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:33,902
I'm going.

796
00:46:35,402 --> 00:46:39,530
Hikaru, Hikaru, Hikaru, Hikaru...

797
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:52,746
I can't believe it.

798
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:54,746
It's disgusting.

799
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:03,746
Be careful.

800
00:47:07,746 --> 00:47:09,746
Can you see it?

801
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:15,746
This is the tent of your favorite owner.

802
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,746
No, no, no.

803
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:20,746
I'm going to go.

804
00:47:20,746 --> 00:47:22,746
I'm going to go.

805
00:47:22,746 --> 00:47:24,746
I'm going to go.

806
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:25,746
No.

807
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:27,746
Look at it carefully.

808
00:47:27,746 --> 00:47:28,746
No.

809
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,746
Look at it carefully.

810
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:32,746
No.

811
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,266
Manager!

812
00:47:47,266 --> 00:47:48,266
What?

813
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,266
We're talking about something else.

814
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,266
What?

815
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:54,266
I told you to put it in.

816
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:56,266
Why are you putting it in there?

817
00:47:56,266 --> 00:47:58,266
I don't know.

818
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,266
Hurry up and put it in.

819
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:04,266
I'm done.

820
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:05,266
Put it in.

821
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,266
It's over.

822
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:09,266
I'm sorry.

823
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:12,266
Let's do it again.

824
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:14,266
Don't put it in.

825
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,266
Why?

826
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:17,266
I put it in.

827
00:48:17,266 --> 00:48:19,266
I put it in.

828
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:24,266
It won't end until you put it in.

829
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,266
I told you.

830
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:29,266
I want a baby.

831
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:32,266
I don't know if it's a baby.

832
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:34,266
It's not moving.

833
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:36,266
That's right.

834
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,266
It's a baby.

835
00:48:38,266 --> 00:48:40,266
It's a baby.

836
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,266
It's not moving.

837
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:44,266
Squeeze it out.

838
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:46,266
It's a baby.

839
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:50,394
Squeeze it out.

840
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,394
You want a baby, don't you?

841
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:56,394
I'm the manager's treasure.

842
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,394
You want a baby, don't you?

843
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,394
You want a baby, don't you?

844
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:02,394
Say you want a baby.

845
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:06,394
I'll make this video popular.

846
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:09,394
I want a baby.

847
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:11,394
Hurry up and move.

848
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:14,394
I'm telling you to move.

849
00:49:14,394 --> 00:49:16,394
I can't.

850
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:20,394
You were doing better when you were a manager.

851
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:23,394
You can't do it anymore.

852
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,394
You can move, right?

853
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:30,394
I'll show you the real thing.

854
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:34,394
Otherwise, the manager...

855
00:49:34,394 --> 00:49:36,394
You have to move.

856
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:38,394
You don't have to.

857
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:43,394
Is it okay?

858
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:47,394
Can I show you the picture of 130,000 people?

859
00:49:48,394 --> 00:49:50,394
And your boyfriend?

860
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,394
Can I show you?

861
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:55,394
Then you know what I'm talking about.

862
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:02,394
Stop it.

863
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:07,394
Please stop it.

864
00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:09,394
Stop it.

865
00:50:09,394 --> 00:50:11,394
Do you want to feel it?

866
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:13,394
Or do you want something stronger?

867
00:50:13,394 --> 00:50:15,394
Stop it.

868
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:18,434
I'll take your nipples.

869
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,434
Do you like this?

870
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:24,434
Stop it.

871
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:27,434
You're going to do it.

872
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:31,434
You're going to do it.

873
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:34,434
I can't.

874
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,434
I can't.

875
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:39,506
Stop it.

876
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:41,898
Stop it.

877
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:45,258
I'm sorry.

878
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,258
Please put the manager's nipples in.

879
00:50:48,258 --> 00:50:52,258
The video will be broadcast all over the world.

880
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,258
Say it.

881
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:56,258
Manager.

882
00:50:57,258 --> 00:51:00,258
Manager, please put my nipples in.

883
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,258
Where?

884
00:51:04,258 --> 00:51:08,258
Please put my nipples in.

885
00:51:08,258 --> 00:51:10,258
Stop it.

886
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:12,258
No.

887
00:51:12,258 --> 00:51:15,674
No.

888
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:24,266
I'm gonna cry.

889
00:51:24,266 --> 00:51:26,266
No!

890
00:51:26,266 --> 00:51:28,266
I have to move alone.

891
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:32,994
No!

892
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:37,338
Stop!

893
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:44,138
Are you okay?

894
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:46,138
Take a good picture.

895
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,138
I can't get in.

896
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:52,138
Help me!

897
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:05,418
How is it?

898
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:07,418
Are you happy?

899
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,418
Let's see.

900
00:52:11,426 --> 00:52:14,426
You are so happy.

901
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:17,426
You took a lot of pictures.

902
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,426
Are you happy?

903
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:24,426
Take a picture of me.

904
00:52:25,426 --> 00:52:31,426
Let's take a picture together.

905
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:33,426
Let's put them together.

906
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:42,426
You took a lot of pictures.

907
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,426
It was fun.

908
00:52:47,426 --> 00:52:49,426
It's not over yet.

909
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:53,426
Let's take a break and continue.

910
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,250
I'm hungry.

911
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,250
I don't have anything.

912
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,290
Hey!

913
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:59,602
Cheers!

914
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,850
Look at this.

915
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,850
How long are you going to do this?

916
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,850
It's so good.

917
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,370
I'm not going to eat this. It's so good.

918
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,890
I'm so tired.

919
00:54:41,618 --> 00:54:43,618
Manager.

920
00:54:45,618 --> 00:54:47,618
How many times did you say that?

921
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,618
You said it too much.

922
00:54:51,618 --> 00:54:53,618
Show me.

923
00:54:57,618 --> 00:54:59,618
I'm a Norwegian.

924
00:55:01,618 --> 00:55:03,618
I'm so excited that I can't breathe.

925
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:06,618
I'm glad you gave me a lot of pictures.

926
00:55:12,618 --> 00:55:14,618
Show me your boyfriend's picture.

927
00:55:15,618 --> 00:55:16,618
No.

928
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,618
Why? He's your friend.

929
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:21,618
Show me.

930
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:23,618
No?

931
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:26,618
Then you can spend time alone.

932
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:27,618
Show me.

933
00:55:32,618 --> 00:55:33,618
It's your bag, isn't it?

934
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:35,618
Stop it.

935
00:55:36,618 --> 00:55:37,618
Stop it.

936
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,322
Don't touch it.

937
00:55:50,322 --> 00:55:52,322
This is it.

938
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:54,322
It's a picture of you and me.

939
00:55:56,322 --> 00:55:58,322
You look so lovely.

940
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,322
What are you taking a picture of?

941
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:03,322
It's good.

942
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:05,322
I'm embarrassed.

943
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,322
Let's take a picture together.

944
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:10,618
What?

945
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,618
When are you going to meet me?

946
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:17,626
I'll see you when you're not wearing a coat.

947
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:18,626
I'm a manager.

948
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,626
You're young, but you're amazing.

949
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:23,626
You're a manager now, right?

950
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:30,626
But you're naked.

951
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:33,626
Stop it.

952
00:56:34,626 --> 00:56:35,626
I don't want to.

953
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:42,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

954
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:44,626
What?

955
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:46,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

956
00:56:47,626 --> 00:56:48,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

957
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:51,626
Manager.

958
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:53,626
Bring me a glass.

959
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:55,626
No.

960
00:56:56,626 --> 00:56:57,626
Why?

961
00:56:58,626 --> 00:56:59,626
You want to go to the bathroom, right?

962
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:01,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

963
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:04,626
Come here.

964
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:08,626
I want to go to the bathroom.

965
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,626
Please take it.

966
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:13,626
Hurry up.

967
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,626
You want me to do it here, right?

968
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:18,626
Do you want me to hold it in?

969
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:24,626
I can't use the bathroom.

970
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:27,626
I'll hold it in or do it here.

971
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:31,626
Hurry up.

972
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:36,106
I'm embarrassed.

973
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:40,106
I know you're not going to take a picture, so hurry up.

974
00:57:41,106 --> 00:57:42,106
I'm embarrassed.

975
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:47,106
You're embarrassed because you're looking at me.

976
00:57:49,106 --> 00:57:51,106
You can't hold it in, can you?

977
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:54,106
I'm holding it in.

978
00:57:57,882 --> 00:57:59,882
I'm holding it in.

979
00:58:03,402 --> 00:58:05,402
You've been holding it in all this time.

980
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:16,402
You've been holding it in all this time.

981
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:22,402
You're wet.

982
00:58:23,402 --> 00:58:24,402
Manager.

983
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,402
Manager.

984
00:58:28,402 --> 00:58:29,402
I can't hold it in.

985
00:58:31,402 --> 00:58:32,402
I can't hold it in.

986
00:58:33,402 --> 00:58:34,402
Why?

987
00:58:35,402 --> 00:58:37,402
I can't hold it in.

988
00:58:39,402 --> 00:58:42,402
You're wet, so wipe it off.

989
00:58:43,402 --> 00:58:44,402
Do I have to wipe it off?

990
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,402
It's your mouth.

991
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:48,402
Hurry up.

992
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:49,402
No.

993
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,402
You can't do that.

994
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:54,402
I can't.

995
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:02,858
You are serious.

996
00:59:02,858 --> 00:59:04,858
Oh, my god!

997
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:07,858
How does it taste?

998
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,858
Salty.

999
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:14,962
You are a good boy.

1000
00:59:15,962 --> 00:59:17,962
You are full of energy.

1001
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:23,962
I'm not done yet.

1002
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:26,962
You are inviting your friends after this, right?

1003
00:59:26,962 --> 00:59:27,962
Yes.

1004
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:31,962
I don't like to be naked.

1005
00:59:31,962 --> 00:59:33,962
It's embarrassing.

1006
00:59:33,962 --> 00:59:35,962
And it's not good.

1007
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:36,962
Wait a minute.

1008
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:38,962
What's that?

1009
00:59:38,962 --> 00:59:40,962
Wait a minute.

1010
00:59:40,962 --> 00:59:45,050
I don't care.

1011
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,050
Do you want to do it again?

1012
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,050
No.

1013
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,050
I don't care.

1014
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,050
I'll take this.

1015
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,050
Put this on.

1016
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,050
Don't you wear it?

1017
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,050
I don't care if you are naked.

1018
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,050
It's embarrassing.

1019
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,058
It's good.

1020
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:08,058
You are a good boy.

1021
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:11,058
Come on.

1022
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:34,514
She really comes.

1023
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:36,514
She's a great person.

1024
01:00:36,514 --> 01:00:38,514
She's a great person.

1025
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,514
You're always like that.

1026
01:00:40,514 --> 01:00:42,514
She's great.

1027
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,514
She's really great.

1028
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:46,514
She's so cute.

1029
01:00:46,514 --> 01:00:48,514
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1030
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:50,514
I'm Aika.

1031
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:52,514
I'm Aika.

1032
01:00:52,514 --> 01:00:54,514
Sit down.

1033
01:00:54,514 --> 01:00:56,514
You're so cute.

1034
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:58,514
Go to the middle.

1035
01:00:58,514 --> 01:01:00,514
You're so cute.

1036
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:02,514
You're so cute.

1037
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:04,514
You're so cute.

1038
01:01:06,514 --> 01:01:08,514
Today,

1039
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:10,514
I'm going to play with you

1040
01:01:10,514 --> 01:01:12,514
as much as I want.

1041
01:01:12,514 --> 01:01:14,514
You can do whatever you want.

1042
01:01:14,514 --> 01:01:16,514
Really?

1043
01:01:16,514 --> 01:01:18,514
I want you to do it.

1044
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:20,514
I want you to do it.

1045
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,474
You're so cute.

1046
01:01:28,474 --> 01:01:30,474
You're so cute.

1047
01:01:30,474 --> 01:01:32,474
You're so cute.

1048
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:34,474
She's always looking at you.

1049
01:01:34,474 --> 01:01:36,474
You're so cute.

1050
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:38,474
I'll kiss you.

1051
01:01:40,474 --> 01:01:42,474
Don't move.

1052
01:01:47,058 --> 01:01:49,058
You're so good at it.

1053
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:51,058
You're so good at it.

1054
01:01:51,058 --> 01:01:53,058
Next, this way.

Next, this way.

1057
01:01:59,058 --> 01:02:01,058
You're so cute.

1058
01:02:01,058 --> 01:02:03,058
You're so cute.

1059
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:05,058
Look at this.

1060
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,058
This is Aika's underwear.

1061
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:09,058
It looks good on you.

1062
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,058
It looks good on you.

1063

I'll show you.

1064
01:02:15,058 --> 01:02:17,058
I'll show you.

1065
01:02:17,058 --> 01:02:19,058
It's so beautiful.

1066
01:02:23,058 --> 01:02:25,058
I can't close my legs.

1067
01:02:25,058 --> 01:02:27,058
I'll touch you.

1068
01:02:27,058 --> 01:02:29,058
I'll touch you.

1069
01:02:29,058 --> 01:02:31,058
I'll touch you.

1070
01:02:35,058 --> 01:02:37,058
Don't take it off.

1071
01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:39,058
I'm taking a lot of pictures.

1072
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:41,058
I'm taking a lot of pictures.

1073
01:02:43,058 --> 01:02:45,058
Are you happy?

1074
01:02:45,058 --> 01:02:47,058
Are you happy?

1075
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:49,058
I'm happy.

1076
01:02:49,058 --> 01:02:51,058
I'm happy.

1077
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,058
I'm happy.

1078
01:02:53,058 --> 01:02:55,058
Isn't it great?

1079
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:57,058
Isn't it great?

1080
01:02:57,058 --> 01:02:59,058
I didn't take it off.

1081
01:02:59,058 --> 01:03:01,058
I didn't take it off.

1082
01:03:03,058 --> 01:03:05,706
Show me your face.

1083
01:03:05,706 --> 01:03:07,706
Show me your face.

1084
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:09,706
Is it comfortable?

1085
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,706
Which is more comfortable?

1086
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,706
Which feels better?

1087
01:03:17,706 --> 01:03:19,706
Wait.

1088
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:21,706
I don't want to wait.

1089
01:03:21,706 --> 01:03:23,706
You are getting bigger.

1090
01:03:28,706 --> 01:03:29,706
No!

1091
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:31,706
Stop it!

1092
01:03:32,706 --> 01:03:34,706
You are closing it.

1093
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:36,706
You like it.

1094
01:03:37,706 --> 01:03:38,706
Do you like it?

1095
01:03:39,706 --> 01:03:40,706
Say it.

1096
01:03:41,706 --> 01:03:42,706
Do you like it?

1097
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:44,706
Do you like it?

1098
01:03:44,706 --> 01:03:45,706
Say it.

1099
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:47,706
Do you like it?

1100
01:03:48,706 --> 01:03:49,706
You couldn't hear it.

1101
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:50,706
Say it again.

1102
01:03:51,706 --> 01:03:52,706
Look at me.

1103
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:54,706
Say you like it.

1104
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,706
Say it.

01:03:58,706 --> 01:03:59,706
You like it.

1106
01:04:01,706 --> 01:04:02,706
Oh, my gosh!

1107
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:04,706
You are saying it.

1108
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:06,706
You like it.

1109
01:04:07,706 --> 01:04:08,706
I like both.

1110
01:04:11,706 --> 01:04:12,706
Do you like it?

1111
01:04:14,706 --> 01:04:15,706
You like it.

1112
01:04:17,706 --> 01:04:18,706
You like it.

Do you like it?

1114
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:25,706
What is that?

1115
01:04:26,706 --> 01:04:27,706
What is that?

1116
01:04:28,706 --> 01:04:29,706
What is that?

1117
01:04:30,706 --> 01:04:31,706
I want to hear it.

1118
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:33,706
You are using it.

1119
01:04:34,706 --> 01:04:35,706
Stop it.

1120
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,706
You used it a lot.

1121
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:39,706
Did you use it a lot?

1122
01:04:40,706 --> 01:04:41,706
You are licking it.

1123
01:04:50,706 --> 01:04:52,706
You are licking it from the top of the panties.

1124
01:04:54,706 --> 01:04:55,706
Like this?

1125
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:57,706
Stop it.

1126
01:04:57,706 --> 01:04:58,706
I didn't use it yet.

1127
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:02,706
You can see it.

1128
01:05:08,706 --> 01:05:09,706
You like it, don't you?

1129
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,706
You bitch.

1130
01:05:12,706 --> 01:05:14,706
You said you like it.

1131
01:05:15,706 --> 01:05:16,706
Your voice is leaking.

1132
01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:21,706
You are using it a lot.

1133
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:23,706
Let me go.

1134
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:25,706
No.

1135
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:29,706
Where are you touching?

1136
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:39,706
You are scratching your body.

1137
01:05:40,706 --> 01:05:41,706
You are disturbing me.

1138
01:05:46,514 --> 01:05:47,514
You are scratching your body.

1139
01:05:48,514 --> 01:05:49,514
Wait.

1140
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,514
Why are you acting like you are nice?

1141
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,514
What?

1142
01:05:56,514 --> 01:06:00,514
When I go to you, you should say you will go.

1143
01:06:01,514 --> 01:06:02,514
So what?

1144
01:06:06,554 --> 01:06:07,554
Let's go.

1145
01:06:17,226 --> 01:06:18,226
No.

1146
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,226
You are holding it.

1147
01:06:22,226 --> 01:06:23,226
You are holding it.

1148
01:06:30,226 --> 01:06:31,226
You are going.

1149
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,226
I'm going.

1150
01:06:38,226 --> 01:06:39,226
I'm going to take a lot of pictures.

1151
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:42,226
You can see it.

1152
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:45,226
You can see it.

1153
01:06:46,226 --> 01:06:47,226
Stop it.

1154
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:52,226
You are using it a lot.

1155
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:54,226
You are using it a lot.

1156
01:06:55,226 --> 01:06:56,226
Stop it.

1157
01:07:00,226 --> 01:07:01,226
You are disturbing me.

1158
01:07:04,226 --> 01:07:05,226
I'm going to clean it.

1159
01:07:13,226 --> 01:07:14,226
You are happy.

1160
01:07:18,226 --> 01:07:20,194
How is it?

1161
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:22,194
You are scratching your body.

1162
01:07:23,194 --> 01:07:24,194
You are using it a lot.

1163
01:07:27,194 --> 01:07:28,194
Wait.

1164
01:07:29,194 --> 01:07:30,194
What?

1165
01:07:31,194 --> 01:07:32,194
Say it.

1166
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:35,194
I'm going.

1167
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:38,802
Stop it.

1168
01:07:39,802 --> 01:07:40,802
You can't use it.

1169
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:44,802
How is it?

1170
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:46,802
Are you happy?

1171
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:48,802
How is it?

1172
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:50,802
You wanted to go.

1173
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:53,802
I don't think so.

1174
01:07:54,802 --> 01:07:55,802
Stop it.

1175
01:08:14,082 --> 01:08:15,082
You are so mean.

1176
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:18,082
Are you sad?

1177
01:08:19,082 --> 01:08:20,082
You wanted to go.

1178
01:08:21,082 --> 01:08:22,082
You wanted to go.

1179
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:24,082
How is it?

1180
01:08:24,082 --> 01:08:26,082
You can go if I say so.

1181
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:32,082
Show me your erotic look.

1182
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:34,082
Show me.

1183
01:08:35,082 --> 01:08:36,082
Put your knees on it.

1184
01:08:37,082 --> 01:08:38,082
Show me.

1185
01:08:43,082 --> 01:08:44,082
What is this?

1186
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:48,082
You were wearing this when you were active.

1187
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,082
I'm going to make you stronger.

1188
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:53,082
How is it?

1189
01:08:54,082 --> 01:08:55,082
Show me.

01:08:56,082 --> 01:08:57,082
Don't wait.

1191
01:08:59,082 --> 01:09:00,082
How is it?

1192
01:09:01,082 --> 01:09:02,082
How is it?

1193
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:04,082
How is it?

1194
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:07,082
Stop it.

1195
01:09:14,882 --> 01:09:15,882
You wanted to go.

1196
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:17,882
You wanted to go.

I'm going to make you stronger.

1200
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:24,882
You can't.

1201
01:09:27,882 --> 01:09:28,882
Stop it.

1202
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:30,882
You can't use it yet.

1203
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:33,882
I'm going to make you stronger.

1204
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:36,882
Your hips are moving.

1205
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:38,882
Put your knees on it.

1206
01:09:39,882 --> 01:09:40,882
Stop it.

1207
01:09:42,882 --> 01:09:43,882
Show me your erotic look.

1208
01:09:44,882 --> 01:09:45,882
You are going to run away.

1209
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:47,882
You are so angry.

1210
01:09:49,882 --> 01:09:50,882
Stop it.

1211
01:09:53,882 --> 01:09:54,882
What is that look?

1212
01:09:56,882 --> 01:09:57,882
Don't stare at me.

1213
01:09:58,882 --> 01:09:59,882
What?

1214
01:10:00,882 --> 01:10:01,882
You want to go?

1215
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:03,882
How is it?

1216
01:10:04,882 --> 01:10:05,882
You can go if I say so.

1217
01:10:08,882 --> 01:10:09,882
I'm going.

1218
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:15,882
What?

1219
01:10:16,882 --> 01:10:17,882
I can't hear you.

1220
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:18,882
I want to hear you.

1221
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:20,882
I can't hear you.

1222
01:10:21,882 --> 01:10:22,882
I want to hear you.

1223
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:24,882
I don't want to say it.

1224
01:10:28,882 --> 01:10:30,882
You are going to get angry if you keep making that face.

1225
01:10:31,882 --> 01:10:32,882
Hurry up.

1226
01:10:33,882 --> 01:10:34,882
How is it?

1227
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,114
I want to go.

1228
01:10:40,114 --> 01:10:41,114
I want to go.

1229
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:43,114
You want to go.

1230
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:46,114
You two make her go.

1231
01:10:48,114 --> 01:10:49,114
I don't want to go.

1232
01:10:50,114 --> 01:10:51,114
You are a pervert.

1233
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:54,114
Stop it.

1234
01:10:56,114 --> 01:10:57,114
Don't take it.

1235
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:13,034
You are so cute.

1236
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:17,034
I put her in the bed earlier.

1237
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:19,034
She was feeling inside.

1238
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:26,034
You love the bed, don't you?

1239
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,034
You are not good at it.

1240
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:32,034
You should attack her inside.

1241
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:34,034
You were good at it.

1242
01:11:34,034 --> 01:11:35,034
I was not.

1243
01:11:35,034 --> 01:11:38,034
You put her in the bed earlier.

1244
01:11:39,034 --> 01:11:41,034
Do you want to sleep?

1245
01:11:42,034 --> 01:11:44,034
You don't want to?

1246
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:46,034
Do you want to stay here?

1247
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:50,034
You should make her wet.

1248
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:01,034
You should make her wet.

1249
01:12:03,034 --> 01:12:04,034
Good girl.

1250
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,034
You are cute.

1251
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:16,034
You were wet.

1252
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:20,034
You are still dry.

1253
01:12:21,034 --> 01:12:23,034
You should put her in the bed.

1254
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:25,034
You should make her wet.

1255
01:12:27,034 --> 01:12:29,034
You are still wet.

1256
01:12:29,034 --> 01:12:31,034
More.

1257
01:12:31,034 --> 01:12:32,034
More.

1258
01:12:40,226 --> 01:12:42,226
You are still wet.

1259
01:12:46,226 --> 01:12:48,226
You are still wet.

1260
01:12:48,226 --> 01:12:50,226
You are so cute.

1261
01:12:52,226 --> 01:12:54,226
You should make her wet.

1262
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:59,226
You are cute.

1263
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:06,034
You are dirty.

1264
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,034
You are wet.

1265
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:12,034
You are wet.

1266
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:14,034
What do you want to do?

1267
01:13:16,034 --> 01:13:18,034
You are wet.

1268
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:20,034
What do you want to do?

1269
01:13:20,034 --> 01:13:22,034
Do you want to be attacked?

1270
01:13:22,034 --> 01:13:24,034
You can sleep.

1271
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:26,034
You wanted to be attacked.

1272
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,034
You are so cute.

1273
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:33,034
You are attacked.

1274
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,034
You are so cute.

1275
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:44,682
Stop it.

1276
01:13:44,682 --> 01:13:46,682
Look at her.

1277
01:13:46,682 --> 01:13:48,682
Stop it.

1278
01:13:50,682 --> 01:13:53,010
Don't put her in the bed.

1279
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,330
You are so cute.

1280
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,330
You can't move her.

1281
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:09,330
You can't move her.

1282
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,330
You are so wet.

1283
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,330
You are beautiful.

1284
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,330
You are so cute.

1285
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,330
You like to be attacked.

1286
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:31,330
You like to be attacked.

1287
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:33,330
You like to be attacked.

1288
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:37,330
Stop it.

1289
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,330
You are so wet.

1290
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,594
Stop it.

1291
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:45,594
No.

1292
01:14:45,594 --> 01:14:47,594
Stop it.

1293
01:14:59,714 --> 01:15:01,714
You can't move her.

1294
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:03,714
You can't move her.

1295
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:12,490
I don't want to cry.

1296
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,490
No.

1297
01:15:24,042 --> 01:15:26,042
This is amazing.

1298
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:28,042
I'll do it.

1299
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:34,042
I'm not in a good mood.

1300
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:36,042
I'm not in a good mood.

1301
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:43,042
What is this?

1302
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:45,042
What is this? Tell me.

1303
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:47,042
What is this feeling?

1304
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,042
I've never experienced this.

1305
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:52,042
What is this?

1306
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:54,042
Stop it.

1307
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:00,010
Tell me.

1308
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,010
Stop it.

1309
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,010
Stop it.

1310
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,170
I feel something.

1311
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:16,170
This is...

1312
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,170
Be more violent.

1313
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,170
I'm not in a good mood.

1314
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,170
Be more violent.

1315
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,170
Stop it.

1316
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,978
This is amazing.

1317
01:16:28,978 --> 01:16:30,978
Stop it.

1318
01:16:30,978 --> 01:16:32,978
Stop it.

1319
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:34,978
I'll do it.

1320
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:36,978
I'm in a good mood.

1321
01:16:37,978 --> 01:16:39,978
Stop it.

1322
01:16:39,978 --> 01:16:41,978
Stop it.

1323
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:44,978
Which one is bigger?

1324
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:48,978
Stop it.

1325
01:16:54,586 --> 01:16:59,586
You said you won't let go of me.

1326
01:16:59,586 --> 01:17:03,586
You said you won't let go of me.

1327
01:17:07,586 --> 01:17:09,586
Help me.

1328
01:17:09,586 --> 01:17:11,586
Help me.

1329
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,882
Help me.

1330
01:17:13,882 --> 01:17:18,546
I'll cry.

1331
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:20,546
I'll cry.

1332
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:23,674
No.

1333
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:35,634
You like to live forever, don't you?

1334
01:17:49,626 --> 01:17:51,626
Don't say that!

1335
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:07,626
You don't have a pain, do you?

1336
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:09,626
Hey, let me read your face.

1337
01:18:09,626 --> 01:18:11,626
Don't move.

1338
01:18:11,626 --> 01:18:14,626
Manager, put this in.

1339
01:18:14,626 --> 01:18:17,626
Let me read your face.

1340
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:21,626
Do you think this will work?

1341
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:23,626
It may be a little too much.

1342
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:25,626
Because you don't react well.

1343
01:18:25,626 --> 01:18:27,626
That's not true.

1344
01:18:27,626 --> 01:18:29,626
I only say no.

1345
01:18:29,626 --> 01:18:31,626
Then, put this in.

1346
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:33,626
What should I do?

1347
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,626
It may be great if you drink from here.

1348
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:37,626
I'm sorry.

1349
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,626
Here we go.

1350
01:18:39,626 --> 01:18:41,626
One, two.

1351
01:18:52,698 --> 01:18:55,090
Oh my god!

1352
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:59,050
Oh my god!

1353
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,050
It smells so good!

1354
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,050
It smells so good!

1355
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:05,050
It smells so good!

1356
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,050
It's not enough, manager!

1357
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,050
More!

1358
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,050
To our friendship!

1359
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,050
To our friendship!

1360
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,050
Cheers!

1361
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,050
Cheers!

1362
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,378
No!

1363
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:21,378
Shake it!

1364
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:24,346
Oh my god!

1365
01:19:24,346 --> 01:19:26,346
Do you want to look at me?

1366
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:29,538
No!

1367
01:19:29,538 --> 01:19:31,538
Ready?

1368
01:19:36,698 --> 01:19:43,698
If you drink this much, you'll get sick.

1369
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,698
You want to drink, don't you?

1370
01:19:48,698 --> 01:19:50,698
I want to drink.

1371
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:52,698
I'll drink.

1372
01:19:52,698 --> 01:19:54,698
Drink.

1373
01:19:54,698 --> 01:19:56,698
It's delicious.

1374
01:19:58,698 --> 01:20:00,698
Is it your first experience?

1375
01:20:00,698 --> 01:20:01,698
Yes.

1376
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:11,698
Don't say, stop it.

1377
01:20:11,698 --> 01:20:13,698
Do you understand?

1378
01:20:13,698 --> 01:20:16,698
Look at this mouth.

1379
01:20:16,698 --> 01:20:19,698
Look at this.

1380
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:22,698
What's in front of you?

1381
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:27,698
What's in front of you?

1382
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,698
You didn't have enough alcohol?

1383
01:20:29,698 --> 01:20:31,698
I want to drink.

1384
01:20:31,698 --> 01:20:36,698
You want to drink, don't you?

1385
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,698
I want to touch you.

1386
01:20:40,698 --> 01:20:43,698
Don't touch me.

1387
01:20:43,698 --> 01:20:47,698
Don't touch me.

1388
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:49,698
You don't have enough alcohol?

1389
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:52,698
I'll do it again if you don't do it properly.

1390
01:20:52,698 --> 01:20:57,698
You should drink it properly.

1391
01:20:58,698 --> 01:21:01,698
Is it delicious?

1392
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:06,698
Look at the camera.

1393
01:21:06,698 --> 01:21:11,698
I'm getting sick.

1394
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,698
I don't know what you're talking about.

1395
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:16,698
Don't do that.

1396
01:21:16,698 --> 01:21:18,698
I want to drink.

1397
01:21:18,698 --> 01:21:21,698
I'm sick.

1398
01:21:27,802 --> 01:21:30,802
I'm sick.

1399
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:34,802
You didn't say you wanted to drink.

1400
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:38,802
I said.

1401
01:21:38,802 --> 01:21:43,802
You should lick it properly.

1402
01:21:43,802 --> 01:21:46,802
It's the best.

1403
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,802
You're getting bigger.

1404
01:21:48,802 --> 01:21:49,802
It's the best.

1405
01:21:49,802 --> 01:21:53,802
You're getting bigger.

1406
01:21:54,802 --> 01:21:57,802
You're good at licking.

1407
01:21:57,802 --> 01:22:00,802
You're good at licking.

1408
01:22:00,802 --> 01:22:05,802
You're a soap woman.

1409
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:07,802
You should lick us.

1410
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:10,802
I'm going to sleep.

1411
01:22:10,802 --> 01:22:13,802
I'm getting sick.

1412
01:22:13,802 --> 01:22:16,802
You should do it properly.

1413
01:22:16,802 --> 01:22:21,802
You know what's in the video, don't you?

1414
01:22:21,802 --> 01:22:24,802
I'm sure you all want to see it.

1415
01:22:24,802 --> 01:22:27,802
You're a soap woman.

1416
01:22:27,802 --> 01:22:31,802
You're a good girl.

1417
01:22:31,802 --> 01:22:38,802
You're a good girl.

1418
01:22:38,802 --> 01:22:40,802
Did you spit it out?

1419
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:49,802
You're a good girl.

1420
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:54,802
You're a good girl.

1421
01:22:54,802 --> 01:22:59,730
You're a good girl.

1422
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:06,634
You're a good girl.

1423
01:23:06,634 --> 01:23:10,634
You're eating with a manko.

1424
01:23:10,634 --> 01:23:14,634
Aika's manko.

1425
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:17,634
Aika's manko.

1426
01:23:17,634 --> 01:23:21,634
I'm going to do it now.

1427
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:27,634
Go.

1428
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:49,386
I'm going to do it now.

1429
01:23:57,386 --> 01:24:00,386
You're a good girl.

1430
01:24:07,386 --> 01:24:09,386
Don't let go of me.

1431
01:24:09,386 --> 01:24:12,386
Don't let go of me.

1432
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:19,386
Put it deeper.

1433
01:24:21,386 --> 01:24:25,386
You're eating with a manko.

1434
01:24:25,386 --> 01:24:29,386
You're a pervert.

1435
01:24:29,386 --> 01:24:32,386
You're a pervert.

1436
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:35,386
You're a pervert.

1437
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:38,386
You're a pervert.

1438
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:41,386
You're a pervert.

1439
01:24:42,386 --> 01:24:45,386
You can give it back to me.

1440
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:50,386
Why are you trying to run away?

1441
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:58,802
I don't know what you're talking about.

1442
01:25:03,802 --> 01:25:06,802
Who said you could let go of me?

1443
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:09,802
Who said you could let go of me?

1444
01:25:09,802 --> 01:25:12,802
I'm going to do it.

1445
01:25:55,602 --> 01:25:57,602
I'm sorry.

1446
01:25:57,602 --> 01:25:59,602
I'm sorry.

1447
01:25:59,602 --> 01:26:01,602
Are you okay?

1448
01:26:03,602 --> 01:26:05,602
You look comfortable.

1449
01:26:07,602 --> 01:26:09,602
Thank you.

1450
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:11,602
You made me feel good.

1451
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,602
No.

1452
01:26:15,602 --> 01:26:17,602
I can't drink it.

1453
01:26:21,602 --> 01:26:23,602
Do you smell it?

1454
01:26:23,602 --> 01:26:25,602
The room smells good.

1455
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:31,602
I'm tired.

1456
01:26:35,602 --> 01:26:37,602
I'm also comfortable.

1457
01:26:37,602 --> 01:26:39,602
Did you like it?

1458
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:43,602
What do you do?

1459
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:47,602
What do you do?

1460
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,602
I can't stand it anymore.

1461
01:26:49,602 --> 01:26:51,602
You want it, don't you?

1462
01:26:51,602 --> 01:26:53,602
You want it, don't you?

1463
01:26:57,602 --> 01:26:59,602
It's long.

1464
01:26:59,602 --> 01:27:01,602
You put it out too much.

1465
01:27:03,602 --> 01:27:05,602
No.

1466
01:27:09,602 --> 01:27:11,602
Open your mouth.

1467
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:13,602
It smells good.

1468
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:15,602
Don't put it out.

1469
01:27:17,602 --> 01:27:19,602
I can't drink it.

1470
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:23,602
What's wrong with you?

1471
01:27:25,602 --> 01:27:27,602
I told you to drink it.

1472
01:27:27,602 --> 01:27:29,602
Why?

1473
01:27:35,786 --> 01:27:38,018
It's disgusting.

1474
01:27:38,018 --> 01:27:40,018
It's disgusting.

1475
01:27:50,922 --> 01:27:52,922
You don't want this anymore, do you?

1476
01:27:53,922 --> 01:27:56,922
You want the real thing, don't you?

1477
01:27:57,922 --> 01:27:59,922
Come on, get up.

1478
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:02,922
You want the real thing now, don't you?

1479
01:28:02,922 --> 01:28:04,922
No, I don't.

1480
01:28:05,922 --> 01:28:07,922
Look, you didn't do it earlier.

1481
01:28:07,922 --> 01:28:08,922
Move.

1482
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:09,922
What?

1483
01:28:09,922 --> 01:28:10,922
Move.

1484
01:28:10,922 --> 01:28:11,922
What?

1485
01:28:11,922 --> 01:28:13,922
No, I'm fine.

1486
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:15,922
You can't do that.

1487
01:28:15,922 --> 01:28:18,922
You almost moved when I put you on the bed.

1488
01:28:18,922 --> 01:28:20,922
No, I don't want to.

1489
01:28:20,922 --> 01:28:21,922
Come on.

1490
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:26,522
No, I don't want to.

1491
01:28:26,522 --> 01:28:27,522
Move.

1492
01:28:27,522 --> 01:28:28,522
What?

1493
01:28:29,522 --> 01:28:32,522
If you don't move, the manager will be angry.

1494
01:28:32,522 --> 01:28:34,522
I can't move.

1495
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:35,522
Why?

1496
01:28:35,522 --> 01:28:36,522
Did you get your back out of the bed?

1497
01:28:36,522 --> 01:28:37,522
Yes.

1498
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:38,522
Because you feel good?

1499
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:39,522
No.

1500
01:28:43,522 --> 01:28:44,522
Stop it.

1501
01:28:44,522 --> 01:28:46,522
Stop it.

1502
01:28:46,522 --> 01:28:48,522
I'll look at you.

1503
01:28:51,522 --> 01:28:52,522
You have a mark.

1504
01:28:55,522 --> 01:28:56,522
Look at me.

1505
01:29:02,522 --> 01:29:03,522
You look like a flying squirrel.

1506
01:29:03,522 --> 01:29:05,522
Come on, put your face to me.

1507
01:29:05,522 --> 01:29:06,522
Yay.

1508
01:29:06,522 --> 01:29:07,522
Yay.

1509
01:29:07,522 --> 01:29:09,522
This is Aika's friend.

1510
01:29:09,522 --> 01:29:11,522
Say cheese.

1511
01:29:11,522 --> 01:29:13,522
Say cheese.

1512
01:29:13,522 --> 01:29:15,522
Come on.

1513
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:16,522
Yay.

1514
01:29:16,522 --> 01:29:17,522
Yay.

1515
01:29:17,522 --> 01:29:18,522
Yay.

1516
01:29:18,522 --> 01:29:23,522
Aika is putting her tail on me.

1517
01:29:23,522 --> 01:29:24,522
Yay.

1518
01:29:24,522 --> 01:29:26,522
You are the best.

1519
01:29:31,522 --> 01:29:32,522
No, no, no.

1520
01:30:04,938 --> 01:30:06,938
You did it!

1521
01:30:06,938 --> 01:30:08,938
You did it!

1522
01:30:15,826 --> 01:30:17,826
What's your name?

1523
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:19,898
Kouta

1524
01:30:21,898 --> 01:30:23,898
You lost to Kouta?

1525
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:25,898
Is that okay?

1526
01:30:32,034 --> 01:30:34,034
I want you to get a lot of them

1527
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,890
What are you doing?

1528
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:44,890
I'm gonna do it.

1529
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:46,890
You should do it over there.

1530
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:48,890
Stop it.

1531
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,890
Over here.

1532
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,890
I'm gonna do it.

1533
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,890
No!

1534
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:03,026
No...

1535
01:31:05,026 --> 01:31:07,386
Oh, no...

1536
01:31:07,386 --> 01:31:12,114
Try it.

1537
01:31:12,114 --> 01:31:14,114
Look at your face.

1538
01:31:16,114 --> 01:31:18,114
You look like a cat.

1539
01:31:18,114 --> 01:31:20,114
You look like a big cat.

1540
01:31:20,114 --> 01:31:22,114
No!

1541
01:31:22,114 --> 01:31:24,114
Look at me.

1542
01:31:24,114 --> 01:31:28,874
No!

1543
01:31:28,874 --> 01:31:30,874
You look like a cat.

1544
01:31:30,874 --> 01:31:32,874
Oh, no!

1545
01:31:32,874 --> 01:31:35,490
Don't stop it.

1546
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,490
Don't stop it.

1547
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:39,490
Oh, no!

1548
01:31:39,490 --> 01:31:41,490
You look like a big cat.

1549
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:43,490
You look like a big cat.

1550
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:45,490
I'm getting excited.

1551
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:47,490
No!

1552
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,490
No!

1553
01:31:49,490 --> 01:31:51,490
How do you feel now?

1554
01:31:51,490 --> 01:31:53,490
Oh, no!

1555
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:56,714
Oh, no!

1556
01:31:56,714 --> 01:31:58,714
Oh, no!

1557
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:00,714
I'm so happy that you're happy.

1558
01:32:00,714 --> 01:32:02,714
I'm so happy that you're happy.

1559
01:32:02,714 --> 01:32:04,714
Oh, no!

1560
01:32:04,714 --> 01:32:06,714
Oh, no!

1561
01:32:06,714 --> 01:32:08,714
Oh, no!

1562
01:32:08,714 --> 01:32:10,714
You look like a big cat.

1563
01:32:10,714 --> 01:32:12,714
Oh, no!

1564
01:32:12,714 --> 01:32:14,714
Oh, no!

1565
01:32:14,714 --> 01:32:16,714
You look like a big cat.

1566
01:32:16,714 --> 01:32:18,714
Open your eyes.

1567
01:32:18,714 --> 01:32:20,714
Open your eyes.

1568
01:32:20,714 --> 01:32:22,714
Oh, no!

1569
01:32:22,714 --> 01:32:24,714
You can see it, right?

1570
01:32:24,714 --> 01:32:26,714
You can see it, right?

1571
01:32:26,714 --> 01:32:28,714
You can see it, right?

1572
01:32:28,714 --> 01:32:30,714
Oh, no!

1573
01:32:30,714 --> 01:32:33,970
Oh, no!

1574
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:35,970
Oh, no!

1575
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,970
Who's crying?

1576
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,970
Who's crying?

1577
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:42,362
Oh, no!

1578
01:32:42,362 --> 01:32:44,362
Who's crying?

1579
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,362
Who's crying?

1580
01:32:55,050 --> 01:32:57,050
Do you feel good?

1581
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:59,050
Do you feel good?

1582
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:01,050
You should admit it.

1583
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:05,050
Then, everyone will do their best.

1584
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:09,050
You should admit it.

1585
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,050
Look!

1586
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:13,050
You must feel good.

1587
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:17,050
Hey!

1588
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,050
Don't pretend to be innocent.

1589
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,050
You're a bitch.

1590
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,050
You're a bitch.

1591
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,050
Oh, no!

1592
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:27,050
Oh, no!

1593
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:29,050
Oh, no!

1594
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:31,050
Oh, no!

1595
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:33,050
Oh, no!

1596
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:35,050
Oh, no!

1597
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:37,050
Oh, no!

1598
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:39,334
Oh, no!

1599
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:44,042
I can't do it anymore.

1600
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:50,042
It's so tight.

1601
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:54,042
I'm so bored.

1602
01:33:58,042 --> 01:34:00,042
I can't do it.

1603
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:04,042
Do it yourself.

1604
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:08,042
It's a pain in the ass.

1605
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:14,042
You can do it.

1606
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:28,042
I can't do it.

1607
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:32,042
I can't do it.

1608
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:34,042
I can't do it.

1609
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:42,042
It's so painful.

1610
01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:44,042
It's in my mouth.

1611
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:48,042
Look at me.

1612
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:52,042
I'm a human.

1613
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:54,042
Which one do you like better?

1614
01:34:56,042 --> 01:34:58,042
Which one?

1615
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:00,042
Which one?

1616
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:06,042
I'm going to have to get a doctor to do it.

1617
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:12,042
It's so hard.

1618
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:14,042
It's so easy.

1619
01:35:24,402 --> 01:35:26,402
You're breathing heavily again.

1620
01:35:28,402 --> 01:35:30,402
Which one do you like better?

1621
01:35:32,402 --> 01:35:34,402
You don't like it?

1622
01:35:34,402 --> 01:35:36,402
Why?

1623
01:35:36,402 --> 01:35:38,402
You said it.

1624
01:35:40,402 --> 01:35:42,402
Let's ask him again.

1625
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:46,402
Which one do you like better?

1626
01:35:46,402 --> 01:35:48,402
Your boyfriend or Ten-chan?

1627
01:35:48,402 --> 01:35:50,402
Ten-chan.

1628
01:35:54,778 --> 01:35:58,642
I did it!

1629
01:35:58,642 --> 01:35:59,642
How do you feel?

1630
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:01,642
It's great!

1631
01:36:01,642 --> 01:36:02,642
I feel great!

1632
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:04,642
I can't hear you.

1633
01:36:04,642 --> 01:36:06,642
I feel great!

1634
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:08,642
I'm really happy.

1635
01:36:08,642 --> 01:36:09,642
I feel great!

1636
01:36:09,642 --> 01:36:13,410
No, no, no!

1637
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:16,410
It's coming!

1638
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:21,410
I'll put this in, too.

1639
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,410
Really?

1640
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,378
I got it.

1641
01:36:25,378 --> 01:36:26,378
No, no, no!

1642
01:36:26,378 --> 01:36:28,378
No, no, no!

1643
01:36:28,378 --> 01:36:30,378
It's coming!

1644
01:36:30,378 --> 01:36:33,338
Oh, no!

1645
01:36:33,338 --> 01:36:35,338
No, no, no!

1646
01:36:39,338 --> 01:36:41,338
It's heavy.

1647
01:36:42,954 --> 01:36:46,114
It hurts.

1648
01:36:54,682 --> 01:36:56,682
It stinks!

1649
01:36:56,682 --> 01:36:58,682
What a waste!

1650
01:36:58,682 --> 01:37:00,682
It's all out.

1651
01:37:00,682 --> 01:37:04,682
It's a waste, so put it in.

1652
01:37:04,682 --> 01:37:06,682
It's a waste.

1653
01:37:08,682 --> 01:37:10,682
It's a waste.

1654
01:37:10,682 --> 01:37:12,682
I don't want to.

1655
01:37:12,682 --> 01:37:14,682
I'll put it all in.

1656
01:37:20,682 --> 01:37:22,682
It's a mess.

1657
01:37:22,682 --> 01:37:24,682
It's a mess.

1658
01:37:24,682 --> 01:37:26,682
It's a mess.

1659
01:37:26,682 --> 01:37:28,682
It's a mess.

1660
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:30,682
You're a bitch.

1661
01:37:32,682 --> 01:37:36,546
It's a mess.

1662
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:44,090
I'll put it in.

1663
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:47,090
You can put it in.

1664
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:49,090
I'll put it in.

1665
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:51,174
No!

1666
01:38:10,714 --> 01:38:12,714
I'll put it in.

1667
01:38:12,714 --> 01:38:14,714
Look, look.

1668
01:38:14,714 --> 01:38:16,714
It's all white.

1669
01:38:16,714 --> 01:38:18,714
It's all wrinkled because of the manager.

1670
01:38:24,714 --> 01:38:26,714
Are you happy?

1671
01:38:30,714 --> 01:38:32,714
Are you happy?

1672
01:38:32,714 --> 01:38:34,714
Look at this.

1673
01:38:34,714 --> 01:38:36,714
It's all wrinkled, isn't it?

1674
01:38:36,714 --> 01:38:38,714
Yes, it is.

1675
01:38:38,714 --> 01:38:40,714
Oh, my.

1676
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,714
Oh, my.

1677
01:38:44,714 --> 01:38:46,714
There are so many spiders.

1678
01:38:46,714 --> 01:38:48,714
It's so cool.

1679
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,714
It's all white.

1680
01:38:50,714 --> 01:38:52,714
It's all white.

1681
01:38:52,714 --> 01:38:56,714
It's a picture of a man who is having sex with a man who is a sexy girl.

1682
01:38:58,714 --> 01:39:00,714
Take a good picture of it.

1683
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:09,314
It's all wrinkled.

1684
01:39:11,314 --> 01:39:13,314
It's all white.

1685
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:15,314
It's all wrinkled.

1686
01:39:17,314 --> 01:39:19,314
I can't do it anymore.

1687
01:39:19,314 --> 01:39:21,314
What are you talking about?

1688
01:39:21,314 --> 01:39:23,314
I can't do it anymore.

1689
01:39:23,314 --> 01:39:25,314
What will happen?

1690
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:27,314
I want to see it.

1691
01:39:27,314 --> 01:39:29,314
What will happen if I do it more?

1692
01:39:31,314 --> 01:39:33,314
What will happen?

1693
01:39:33,314 --> 01:39:35,314
I want to see it.

1694
01:39:35,314 --> 01:39:37,314
I can't do it.

1695
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,410
I'm so happy.

1696
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,410
I'm so happy.

1697
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:24,410
Are you going to be weird?

1698
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:34,410
Move yourself.

1699
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:38,410
You can move, right?

1700
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:40,410
I'm so happy.

1701
01:40:45,634 --> 01:40:47,634
I heard that Aiko's drawing is amazing.

1702
01:40:51,634 --> 01:40:53,634
I want to see it.

1703
01:40:55,634 --> 01:40:57,634
I want to see it.

1704
01:40:59,634 --> 01:41:01,634
Is it like this?

1705
01:41:01,634 --> 01:41:03,634
Is it like this?

1706
01:41:03,634 --> 01:41:05,634
Show me more.

1707
01:41:07,634 --> 01:41:09,634
Show me more.

1708
01:41:09,634 --> 01:41:11,634
I'm so happy.

1709
01:41:32,506 --> 01:41:34,506
Do you feel good?

1710
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,506
Do you feel good?

1711
01:41:36,506 --> 01:41:38,506
You can move more.

1712
01:41:40,506 --> 01:41:42,506
No, no, no.

1713
01:41:56,866 --> 01:41:58,866
You're going to be weird.

1714
01:41:58,866 --> 01:42:00,866
You're going to be weird.

1715
01:42:00,866 --> 01:42:02,866
You're going to be weird.

1716
01:42:02,866 --> 01:42:04,866
You're going to be weird.

1717
01:42:04,866 --> 01:42:06,866
No, no, no.

1718
01:42:06,866 --> 01:42:08,866
I can't stand it anymore.

1719
01:42:10,866 --> 01:42:12,866
Where do you want it?

1720
01:42:12,866 --> 01:42:14,866
Where do you want it?

1721
01:42:14,866 --> 01:42:16,866
Tell me.

1722
01:42:20,866 --> 01:42:22,866
Tell me.

1723
01:42:22,866 --> 01:42:24,866
Tell me where you want it.

1724
01:42:28,866 --> 01:42:30,866
Where do you want it?

1725
01:42:30,866 --> 01:42:32,866
Tell me quickly.

1726
01:42:32,866 --> 01:42:34,866
Tell me quickly.

1727
01:42:34,866 --> 01:42:36,866
I can't stand it anymore.

1728
01:42:36,866 --> 01:42:38,866
I can't stand it anymore.

1729
01:42:38,866 --> 01:42:40,866
I can't stand it anymore.

1730
01:42:40,866 --> 01:42:42,866
I can't stand it anymore.

1731
01:42:42,866 --> 01:42:44,866
I can't stand it anymore.

1732
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:23,070
I'm so glad you gave me so much.

1733
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:27,070
I'm so glad you gave me so much.

1734
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:31,070
I'm so glad you came back to the beach.

1735
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:36,070
Is it okay to give me so much?

1736
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:38,070
I'm so full.

1737
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:40,070
Oh, no. You gave her so much.

1738
01:43:41,070 --> 01:43:43,070
I'm so full.

1739
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:46,070
I'm so full.

1740
01:43:54,778 --> 01:43:56,778
You're so excited.

1741
01:43:57,778 --> 01:43:59,778
I'm going to pay for this.

1742
01:43:59,778 --> 01:44:00,778
That's great.

1743
01:44:01,778 --> 01:44:02,778
That's good.

1744
01:44:11,946 --> 01:44:13,946
Hey, the store is closed today.

1745
01:44:13,946 --> 01:44:14,946
Let's go.

1746
01:44:14,946 --> 01:44:15,946
Really?

1747
01:44:15,946 --> 01:44:16,946
Isn't it bad?

1748
01:44:16,946 --> 01:44:17,946
Yes.

1749
01:44:17,946 --> 01:44:18,946
Okay.

1750
01:44:18,946 --> 01:44:19,946
I'll do my best.

1751
01:44:20,946 --> 01:44:21,946
See you.

1752
01:44:21,946 --> 01:44:27,210
She is the best owner.

1753
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:29,210
I don't think I can do this.

1754
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,210
I don't think so.

1755
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:35,210
You were very excited.

1756
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:37,210
I can't.

1757
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:46,210
I was surprised that you didn't make too much noise.

1758
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:47,210
You can hear it.

1759
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:53,210
You're a baby.

1760
01:45:02,074 --> 01:45:05,574
You're late! I finally got here!

1761
01:45:05,574 --> 01:45:06,574
Sorry!

1762
01:45:06,574 --> 01:45:07,574
What were you doing?

1763
01:45:07,574 --> 01:45:09,574
I was just picking up girls.

1764
01:45:11,574 --> 01:45:13,574
You're the worst!

1765
01:45:15,074 --> 01:45:19,074
My friend is here!

1766
01:45:20,574 --> 01:45:23,074
You were lonely after the manager left.

1767
01:45:25,574 --> 01:45:26,574
It's real!

1768
01:45:27,574 --> 01:45:29,574
Super famous influencer!

1769
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:32,074
You noticed?

1770
01:45:32,074 --> 01:45:33,074
I did.

1771
01:45:33,074 --> 01:45:34,074
You're so chubby!

1772
01:45:34,074 --> 01:45:35,074
You noticed?

1773
01:45:35,074 --> 01:45:37,074
What's with that outfit?

1774
01:45:37,074 --> 01:45:38,574
Let's get closer.

1775
01:45:38,574 --> 01:45:40,574
Let's toast!

1776
01:45:41,574 --> 01:45:43,574
Hold this.

1777
01:45:46,074 --> 01:45:48,074
To our wonderful meeting today!

1778
01:45:48,074 --> 01:45:49,074
Really?

1779
01:45:49,074 --> 01:45:51,074
Nice to meet you!

1780
01:45:52,074 --> 01:45:54,074
To our wonderful meeting today!

1781
01:45:54,074 --> 01:45:56,074
Cheers!

1782
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:03,022
It's so good!

1783
01:46:03,022 --> 01:46:06,022
Look at my Aika!

1784
01:46:06,022 --> 01:46:08,022
What?

1785
01:46:08,022 --> 01:46:10,022
You're not being nice.

1786
01:46:10,022 --> 01:46:13,022
I'm going to get more love from you.

1787
01:46:13,022 --> 01:46:15,022
So you should be nicer.

1788
01:46:15,022 --> 01:46:18,022
You can't say hi to me.

1789
01:46:20,022 --> 01:46:21,022
Mao.

1790
01:46:21,022 --> 01:46:24,022
Do you want to see me being a pervert?

1791
01:46:26,022 --> 01:46:27,022
You want to see me, right?

1792
01:46:27,022 --> 01:46:28,022
I do!

1793
01:46:28,022 --> 01:46:30,022
Why are you showing me?

1794
01:46:30,022 --> 01:46:34,022
You're just jealous of me.

1795
01:46:34,022 --> 01:46:35,022
What?

1796
01:46:35,022 --> 01:46:39,022
I'm a successful soap actress.

1797
01:46:39,022 --> 01:46:41,022
You're still a soap actress.

1798
01:46:41,022 --> 01:46:43,022
What are you talking about?

1799
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,022
You're crazy.

1800
01:46:45,022 --> 01:46:48,022
You're jealous of me.

1801
01:46:50,022 --> 01:46:54,022
You're crazy!

1802
01:46:54,022 --> 01:46:56,022
Is that all you want to say?

1803
01:46:57,022 --> 01:47:00,022
I'll show you my pervert side.

1804
01:47:02,022 --> 01:47:05,022
You're satisfied with that, right?

1805
01:47:05,022 --> 01:47:08,022
You're so motivated.

1806
01:47:08,022 --> 01:47:09,022
What?

1807
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:11,022
Hey!

1808
01:47:11,022 --> 01:47:13,022
Hey!

1809
01:47:15,022 --> 01:47:17,022
Hey!

1810
01:47:20,022 --> 01:47:22,022
You're so aggressive.

1811
01:47:27,022 --> 01:47:30,022
You want to see this?

1812
01:47:30,022 --> 01:47:33,022
Can you do that?

1813
01:47:44,382 --> 01:47:46,382
You're so aggressive.

1814
01:47:46,382 --> 01:47:48,382
My arm hurts.

1815
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:54,382
You wanted to see this?

1816
01:47:54,382 --> 01:47:56,382
It feels good.

1817
01:47:56,382 --> 01:47:58,382
It's hot.

1818
01:47:58,382 --> 01:48:00,382
It's hot.

1819
01:48:08,382 --> 01:48:10,382
You're so erotic.

1820
01:48:13,382 --> 01:48:15,382
More.

1821
01:48:24,382 --> 01:48:26,382
I want to see your pervert side.

1822
01:48:26,382 --> 01:48:28,382
Really?

1823
01:48:36,382 --> 01:48:38,382
You're so erotic.

1824
01:48:43,382 --> 01:48:45,382
You're so different from before.

1825
01:48:55,382 --> 01:48:57,382
You're so good.

1826
01:48:57,382 --> 01:49:00,382
Do you like erotic people?

1827
01:49:00,382 --> 01:49:02,382
I like them.

1828
01:49:02,382 --> 01:49:04,382
You're so good.

1829
01:49:11,382 --> 01:49:13,382
Do you like that?

1830
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,382
I love you.

1831
01:49:18,382 --> 01:49:20,382
You're so good.

1832
01:49:20,382 --> 01:49:22,382
You're so good.

1833
01:49:26,182 --> 01:49:28,182
You're so good.

1834
01:49:31,182 --> 01:49:34,182
I want you to do more.

1835
01:49:39,182 --> 01:49:41,182
You're so good.

1836
01:49:41,182 --> 01:49:43,182
I love you.

1837
01:49:47,182 --> 01:49:49,182
You're so good.

1838
01:49:49,182 --> 01:49:51,182
You're so good.

1839
01:49:54,182 --> 01:49:56,182
You want me to do that?

1840
01:49:56,182 --> 01:49:58,182
I want to do that.

1841
01:49:58,182 --> 01:50:00,182
Can I do that?

1842
01:50:00,182 --> 01:50:02,182
Can I do that?

1843
01:50:02,182 --> 01:50:04,182
Can I do that?

1844
01:50:04,182 --> 01:50:06,182
I'll do it slowly.

1845
01:50:14,182 --> 01:50:16,182
Is it painful?

1846
01:50:19,182 --> 01:50:21,182
It's so hot.

1847
01:50:21,182 --> 01:50:23,182
It's so hot.

1848
01:50:27,182 --> 01:50:30,182
You wanted to see my pervert side, right?

1849
01:50:31,182 --> 01:50:33,182
It's good.

1850
01:50:35,182 --> 01:50:37,182
It's good.

1851
01:50:37,182 --> 01:50:39,182
It's so hot.

1852
01:50:49,182 --> 01:50:51,182
It's so hot.

1853
01:50:53,182 --> 01:50:55,182
It's good, right?

1854
01:50:59,182 --> 01:51:01,182
It's so hot.

1855
01:51:02,182 --> 01:51:04,182
I can do that.

1856
01:51:05,182 --> 01:51:07,182
You're so good.

1857
01:51:07,182 --> 01:51:09,182
You want me to do that?

1858
01:51:17,182 --> 01:51:19,182
You can't.

1859
01:51:19,182 --> 01:51:22,182
You want me to do that, right?

1860
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:30,182
You're so good.

1861
01:51:35,182 --> 01:51:37,182
You're so good.

1862
01:51:38,182 --> 01:51:42,182
I like your face when you're angry.

1863
01:51:46,182 --> 01:51:48,350
It's not in there.

1864
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:55,350
You can't do that yet.

1865
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,350
You can do that.

1866
01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:00,350
You're the best, right?

1867
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,350
You can do that.

1868
01:52:02,350 --> 01:52:04,350
You can do that.

1869
01:52:10,222 --> 01:52:12,222
You hit me.

1870
01:52:13,222 --> 01:52:15,222
You're so good.

1871
01:52:17,222 --> 01:52:19,222
It's fun.

1872
01:52:19,222 --> 01:52:21,222
I'm getting scared.

1873
01:52:24,222 --> 01:52:26,222
I want more.

1874
01:52:26,222 --> 01:52:28,222
You want more?

1875
01:52:28,222 --> 01:52:30,222
You're so good.

1876
01:52:51,222 --> 01:52:53,222
Can I touch you?

1877
01:52:53,222 --> 01:52:55,222
Can I touch you?

1878
01:52:55,222 --> 01:52:57,222
Can I touch you?

1879
01:52:59,222 --> 01:53:01,222
More.

1880
01:53:01,222 --> 01:53:03,222
More?

1881
01:53:03,222 --> 01:53:05,222
More.

1882
01:53:08,358 --> 01:53:10,974
It's so good.

1883
01:53:13,974 --> 01:53:16,302
It's so good.

1884
01:53:16,302 --> 01:53:20,134
You can't.

1885
01:53:26,134 --> 01:53:28,134
Come here.

1886
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:30,134
Come here.

1887
01:53:30,134 --> 01:53:32,134
Your face.

1888
01:53:32,134 --> 01:53:34,134
You're so good.

1889
01:53:35,134 --> 01:53:38,134
I'll show you my sexiness.

1890
01:53:38,134 --> 01:53:40,134
I'll show you my sexiness.

1891
01:53:40,134 --> 01:53:43,134
You'll like me more.

1892
01:53:44,134 --> 01:53:47,134
You'll show me your sexiness, right?

1893
01:53:48,134 --> 01:53:50,134
Show me.

1894
01:53:50,134 --> 01:53:52,134
You can't.

1895
01:53:53,134 --> 01:53:55,134
You can't.

1896
01:53:55,134 --> 01:53:57,134
Look.

1897
01:53:57,134 --> 01:53:59,134
You're already on my face.

1898
01:54:00,134 --> 01:54:02,134
I'm relieved.

1899
01:54:02,134 --> 01:54:04,134
I'm relieved.

1900
01:54:05,134 --> 01:54:08,134
My 130,000 followers.

1901
01:54:08,134 --> 01:54:10,134
She's crazy.

1902
01:54:10,134 --> 01:54:12,134
Good evening.

1903
01:54:13,134 --> 01:54:19,134
Watch me getting sexy.

1904
01:54:23,134 --> 01:54:25,134
What's wrong?

1905
01:54:26,134 --> 01:54:29,134
Are you okay?

1906
01:54:32,134 --> 01:54:36,134
I have to show you more.

1907
01:54:36,134 --> 01:54:38,134
I can't see you.

1908
01:54:38,134 --> 01:54:40,134
You can't see me?

1909
01:54:43,134 --> 01:54:45,134
Inside?

1910
01:54:47,134 --> 01:54:50,134
You have a lot of pimples.

1911
01:54:57,518 --> 01:54:59,518
Are you okay?

1912
01:55:01,974 --> 01:55:04,974
I can see you.

1913
01:55:04,974 --> 01:55:06,974
You're crazy.

1914
01:55:06,974 --> 01:55:08,974
More.

1915
01:55:08,974 --> 01:55:13,550
I'll do it.

1916
01:55:22,106 --> 01:55:24,106
I feel so good!

1917
01:55:29,106 --> 01:55:31,106
I'm going to go.

1918
01:55:31,106 --> 01:55:33,106
I'm going to go.

1919
01:55:33,106 --> 01:55:35,106
I'm going to go.

1920
01:55:36,106 --> 01:55:41,882
Babu, she's going to live for 130,000 years.

1921
01:55:41,882 --> 01:55:43,882
This guy.

1922
01:55:43,882 --> 01:55:45,882
I'm so happy.

1923
01:55:50,954 --> 01:55:52,954
I'm going crazy.

1924
01:55:52,954 --> 01:55:54,954
I'm so happy.

1925
01:55:54,954 --> 01:55:56,954
I'm so happy.

1926
01:55:58,954 --> 01:56:00,954
I want a baby.

1927
01:56:02,954 --> 01:56:04,954
Are you sure?

1928
01:56:04,954 --> 01:56:06,954
I'm sure.

1929
01:56:09,954 --> 01:56:11,954
I got a baby.

1930
01:56:13,954 --> 01:56:15,954
I'm so happy.

1931
01:56:21,954 --> 01:56:24,954
I want to do more live streaming.

1932
01:56:28,954 --> 01:56:30,954
I'm going to go.

1933
01:56:36,954 --> 01:56:38,954
It's so sour.

1934
01:56:39,954 --> 01:56:41,954
I'm going to drink this water.

1935
01:56:47,954 --> 01:56:49,954
That's great.

1936
01:56:51,954 --> 01:56:55,242
That's great.

1937
01:56:55,242 --> 01:56:57,242
It's hitting my throat.

1938
01:56:59,242 --> 01:57:01,242
You're doing it yourself?

1939
01:57:11,242 --> 01:57:13,242
It feels good.

1940
01:57:29,242 --> 01:57:31,242
I'm so happy.

1941
01:57:34,242 --> 01:57:36,242
I can't do live streaming.

1942
01:57:36,242 --> 01:57:38,242
I'm so happy.

1943
01:57:40,242 --> 01:57:42,242
I can't do live streaming.

1944
01:57:46,242 --> 01:57:48,242
My followers want to see this.

1945
01:57:50,242 --> 01:57:56,242
If you want to see it, show me what you want to see.

1946
01:57:58,242 --> 01:58:00,242
I'm so happy.

1947
01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:04,242
Which one do you want to put in?

1948
01:58:05,242 --> 01:58:07,242
I don't know.

1949
01:58:11,242 --> 01:58:13,242
Which one do you want to put in?

1950
01:58:13,242 --> 01:58:15,242
I'll put in here.

1951
01:58:15,242 --> 01:58:17,242
Really?

1952
01:58:21,242 --> 01:58:23,242
I want to go behind you.

1953
01:58:26,242 --> 01:58:28,242
I don't want to.

1954
01:58:34,242 --> 01:58:36,242
I'm going to put it in here.

1955
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:41,242
Oh no, oh no, I'm gonna climax.

1956
01:58:41,242 --> 01:58:43,242
I'm gonna climax.

1957
01:58:47,242 --> 01:58:49,242
It's so narrow.

1958
01:58:50,242 --> 01:58:52,242
I'm gonna climax.

1959
01:58:53,242 --> 01:58:54,242
I'm gonna climax.

1960
01:58:56,242 --> 01:59:00,242
Mao-san, are you jealous of me?

1961
01:59:01,242 --> 01:59:02,242
No way.

1962
01:59:03,242 --> 01:59:05,242
You're crazy.

1963
01:59:06,242 --> 01:59:09,242
I've been streaming for 130,000 years.

1964
01:59:10,242 --> 01:59:12,242
Oh no, oh no, I'm gonna climax.

1965
01:59:13,242 --> 01:59:18,242
There are people who are jealous of me because I'm comfortable.

1966
01:59:20,242 --> 01:59:22,242
Of course.

1967
01:59:22,242 --> 01:59:23,242
More?

1968
01:59:23,242 --> 01:59:24,242
More.

1969
01:59:24,242 --> 01:59:26,242
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1970
01:59:31,242 --> 01:59:33,242
I'm gonna climax.

1971
01:59:33,242 --> 01:59:36,242
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

1972
01:59:53,362 --> 01:59:54,362
It feels good.

1973
01:59:54,362 --> 01:59:56,362
I'm gonna climax.

1974
01:59:57,362 --> 01:59:59,362
Don't climax.

1975
02:00:00,362 --> 02:00:02,362
Don't climax.

1976
02:00:03,362 --> 02:00:05,362
I'm gonna climax.

1977
02:00:09,714 --> 02:00:11,714
You're streaming live.

1978
02:00:11,714 --> 02:00:13,714
You're so jealous.

1979
02:00:14,714 --> 02:00:16,714
I'm gonna climax.

1980
02:00:17,714 --> 02:00:19,714
Mom, you can't do that.

1981
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:24,714
I want to go to the bathroom.

1982
02:00:25,714 --> 02:00:27,714
Sit down.

1983
02:00:28,714 --> 02:00:30,714
Put it in.

1984
02:00:34,714 --> 02:00:38,714
I'm gonna climax.

1985
02:00:40,714 --> 02:00:42,714
I'm gonna climax.

1986
02:00:47,714 --> 02:00:49,714
It's so hard.

1987
02:00:54,714 --> 02:00:56,714
It feels good.

1988
02:00:56,714 --> 02:00:58,714
It feels good.

1989
02:01:04,714 --> 02:01:06,714
Why are you moving?

1990
02:01:07,714 --> 02:01:09,714
Of course.

1991
02:01:10,714 --> 02:01:12,714
I'm gonna climax.

1992
02:01:12,714 --> 02:01:14,714
You're crazy.

1993
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:20,170
Why are you stopping?

1994
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:22,170
Don't stop.

1995
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:25,170
I'm gonna climax.

1996
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:27,170
I'm gonna climax.

1997
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:29,170
There.

1998
02:01:36,410 --> 02:01:38,410
I'm so sorry.

1999
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:40,410
I'm so sorry.

2000
02:01:44,410 --> 02:01:46,410
You don't like this, do you?

2001
02:01:46,410 --> 02:01:48,410
One more time.

2002
02:02:05,474 --> 02:02:07,474
There are so many people watching us.

2003
02:02:07,474 --> 02:02:09,474
They are watching us.

2004
02:02:09,474 --> 02:02:11,474
I'm so happy.

2005
02:02:17,474 --> 02:02:19,474
I'm so happy.

2006
02:02:23,474 --> 02:02:25,474
Please lick me more.

2007
02:02:33,474 --> 02:02:35,474
How do you like my butt?

2008
02:02:35,474 --> 02:02:37,474
It's the best.

2009
02:02:37,474 --> 02:02:39,474
I'm so happy.

2010
02:02:41,474 --> 02:02:43,474
Please put your tongue out.

2011
02:02:54,458 --> 02:02:56,458
It's amazing.

2012
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:06,458
That's amazing.

2013
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:14,458
Are you okay?

2014
02:03:14,458 --> 02:03:16,458
I'm okay.

2015
02:03:16,458 --> 02:03:18,458
I'm so sorry.

2016
02:03:20,458 --> 02:03:22,458
I want to go.

2017
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:28,458
My mouth feels weird.

2018
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:32,458
My mouth feels weird.

2019
02:03:36,458 --> 02:03:38,458
My mouth feels weird.

2020
02:03:40,458 --> 02:03:42,458
I'm sorry.

2021
02:03:51,034 --> 02:03:53,034
I'm scared from here.

2022
02:03:53,034 --> 02:03:55,034
Oh, my God.

2023
02:04:01,034 --> 02:04:03,034
Oh, my God.

2024
02:04:03,034 --> 02:04:05,034
Oh, my God.

2025
02:04:05,034 --> 02:04:07,034
I told you to be quiet.

2026
02:04:11,034 --> 02:04:13,034
I'll put it here.

2027
02:04:13,034 --> 02:04:15,034
Lick it.

2028
02:04:21,034 --> 02:04:23,034
I'll put it here.

2029
02:04:23,034 --> 02:04:25,042
I'll put it here.

2030
02:04:31,042 --> 02:04:33,042
I'll put it here.

2031
02:04:39,042 --> 02:04:41,042
I'm so scared.

2032
02:04:43,042 --> 02:04:45,042
Oh, my God.

2033
02:04:45,042 --> 02:04:47,042
Oh, my God.

2034
02:04:47,042 --> 02:04:49,042
Oh, my God.

2035
02:04:53,242 --> 02:04:55,242
Oh, my God.

2036
02:04:55,242 --> 02:04:57,126
Oh, my God.

2037
02:05:02,458 --> 02:05:04,458
Oh, my God.

2038
02:05:04,458 --> 02:05:06,458
Oh, my God.

2039
02:05:06,458 --> 02:05:08,458
Oh, my God.

2040
02:05:08,458 --> 02:05:10,458
Oh, my God.

2041
02:05:10,458 --> 02:05:12,458
Pussy is soaked.

2042
02:05:14,458 --> 02:05:16,458
Was she like this?

2043
02:05:18,458 --> 02:05:20,458
She's having a lot of fun.

2044
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:24,458
I'm kind of pissed off.

2045
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:35,050
It's so good!

2046
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:37,050
It's so good!

2047
02:05:49,066 --> 02:05:51,066
Don't stop me!

2048
02:05:51,066 --> 02:05:53,066
Don't stop me!

2049
02:05:53,066 --> 02:05:55,066
It's good!

2050
02:05:57,066 --> 02:05:59,066
It's good!

2051
02:06:01,066 --> 02:06:03,066
It's good!

2052
02:06:07,066 --> 02:06:09,066
It's good!

2053
02:06:13,066 --> 02:06:15,066
It's good!

2054
02:06:21,066 --> 02:06:23,066
I can't stop!

2055
02:06:23,066 --> 02:06:25,066
I can't stop!

2056
02:06:25,066 --> 02:06:27,066
I can't stop!

2057
02:06:31,202 --> 02:06:33,202
It's good!

2058
02:06:49,114 --> 02:06:51,114
I'm so happy!

2059
02:06:51,114 --> 02:06:53,114
I'm so happy!

2060
02:06:57,362 --> 02:06:59,362
Does it feel good, Mao?

2061
02:07:00,362 --> 02:07:02,362
It feels good!

2062
02:07:07,266 --> 02:07:09,266
It feels good to the point that I feel like I'm going to climax.

2063
02:07:09,266 --> 02:07:12,266
Mao, did you climax again?

2064
02:07:16,562 --> 02:07:18,562
Mao is not coming out.

2065
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:29,714
Don't do it!

2066
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:54,330
It's so tight!

2067
02:08:13,674 --> 02:08:15,674
Feels good!

2068
02:08:34,234 --> 02:08:36,234
My legs hurt.

2069
02:08:41,234 --> 02:08:43,234
Oh, no.

2070
02:08:50,386 --> 02:08:52,386
I think it's almost time.

2071
02:08:52,386 --> 02:08:54,386
What's wrong?

2072
02:08:54,386 --> 02:08:56,386
I'm happy.

2073
02:08:58,386 --> 02:09:00,386
Wait a minute.

2074
02:09:00,386 --> 02:09:02,386
Let's go over there.

2075
02:09:06,386 --> 02:09:08,386
Where are you?

2076
02:09:08,386 --> 02:09:10,386
Here?

2077
02:09:10,386 --> 02:09:12,386
Come here.

2078
02:09:14,386 --> 02:09:16,386
I'm here.

2079
02:09:20,386 --> 02:09:23,738
I'm here.

2080
02:09:27,738 --> 02:09:29,738
Come here.

2081
02:09:29,738 --> 02:09:31,738
Look at me.

2082
02:09:32,738 --> 02:09:34,738
Do you know who I am?

2083
02:09:35,738 --> 02:09:37,738
Do you know who I am?

2084
02:09:41,386 --> 02:09:45,386
Your girlfriend was actually this bitch.

2085
02:09:47,682 --> 02:09:49,682
Are you happy?

2086
02:09:49,682 --> 02:09:51,682
Are you happy?

2087
02:09:51,682 --> 02:09:53,682
Poor girl.

2088
02:09:53,682 --> 02:09:55,682
It hurts.

2089
02:09:55,682 --> 02:09:57,682
I feel good now.

2090
02:10:00,266 --> 02:10:02,266
You're crazy.

2091
02:10:02,266 --> 02:10:04,266
You're crazy.

2092
02:10:04,266 --> 02:10:06,266
I feel good now.

2093
02:10:06,266 --> 02:10:08,266
You're crazy.

2094
02:10:10,266 --> 02:10:12,266
You're crazy.

2095
02:10:12,266 --> 02:10:14,266
Let's have fun over there.

2096
02:10:16,266 --> 02:10:18,266
Don't stop me.

2097
02:10:18,266 --> 02:10:20,266
No.

2098
02:10:24,266 --> 02:10:26,266
I'm going home.

2099
02:10:26,266 --> 02:10:28,266
I'm going home.

2100
02:10:32,266 --> 02:10:34,266
I'm so happy.

2101
02:10:34,266 --> 02:10:36,266
I'm so happy.

2102
02:10:36,266 --> 02:10:38,266
Look at me.

2103
02:10:38,266 --> 02:10:40,266
I'm so happy.

2104
02:10:40,266 --> 02:10:42,266
I'm so happy.

2105
02:10:42,266 --> 02:10:44,266
I'm so happy.

2106
02:10:46,266 --> 02:10:48,266
I'm so happy.

2107
02:10:54,266 --> 02:10:56,266
This is who I am.

2108
02:10:56,266 --> 02:10:58,266
This is who I am.

2109
02:10:59,266 --> 02:11:01,266
I feel good.

2110
02:11:02,266 --> 02:11:04,266
I'm so happy.

2111
02:11:04,266 --> 02:11:07,490
I'm so happy.

2112
02:11:59,722 --> 02:12:03,722
Wow! You are so strong!

2113
02:12:04,722 --> 02:12:07,722
Do you have such a hobby?

2114
02:12:08,722 --> 02:12:09,722
Are you a pervert?

2115
02:12:10,722 --> 02:12:11,722
Are you a pervert couple?

2116
02:12:13,722 --> 02:12:16,722
You are getting stronger.

2117
02:12:17,722 --> 02:12:18,722
Look!

2118
02:12:22,722 --> 02:12:25,722
Your boyfriend was a pervert.

2119
02:12:30,722 --> 02:12:34,722
He is excited to see his girlfriend taking a video of him.

2120
02:12:42,722 --> 02:12:43,722
Do you feel good?

2121
02:12:43,722 --> 02:12:44,722
What do you mean?

2122
02:12:45,722 --> 02:12:48,722
Which do you feel good? Aika or me?

2123
02:12:48,722 --> 02:12:59,722
This is the best of Aika's boyfriend.

2124
02:13:11,722 --> 02:13:14,722
You are a bad girl.

2125
02:13:18,722 --> 02:13:20,722
You are a bad girl.

2126
02:13:32,722 --> 02:13:34,722
Which do you like?

2127
02:13:35,722 --> 02:13:36,722
Tell me.

2128
02:13:36,722 --> 02:13:38,722
Which do you like?

2129
02:13:38,722 --> 02:13:39,722
It doesn't matter.

2130
02:13:40,722 --> 02:13:42,722
Which do you like?

2131
02:13:44,722 --> 02:13:45,722
Tell me.

2132
02:13:45,722 --> 02:13:48,722
You are getting stronger.

2133
02:13:59,722 --> 02:14:02,722
Aika, look!

2134
02:14:03,722 --> 02:14:05,722
She was watching.

2135
02:14:05,722 --> 02:14:07,722
Look!

2136
02:14:08,722 --> 02:14:10,722
Look! Aika is being attacked.

2137
02:14:10,722 --> 02:14:13,722
Her boyfriend is being a pervert.

2138
02:14:13,722 --> 02:14:15,722
Are you serious?

2139
02:14:20,722 --> 02:14:21,722
Can I touch you?

2140
02:14:23,722 --> 02:14:24,722
Can I?

2141
02:14:24,722 --> 02:14:25,722
Oh, my!

2142
02:14:28,722 --> 02:14:29,722
I can't see.

2143
02:14:30,722 --> 02:14:31,722
Let me see.

2144
02:14:32,722 --> 02:14:33,722
Aika!

2145
02:14:43,722 --> 02:14:45,722
You are getting stronger.

2146
02:14:45,722 --> 02:14:47,722
Let me see your lips.

2147
02:14:48,722 --> 02:14:50,722
You are getting stronger.

2148
02:14:50,722 --> 02:14:52,722
You are getting stronger.

2149
02:14:57,466 --> 02:14:59,466
It feels good.

2150
02:14:59,466 --> 02:15:01,466
It feels good.

2151
02:15:10,178 --> 02:15:14,178
I've never seen such a good baby.

2152
02:15:16,178 --> 02:15:19,178
Aika, look closer.

2153
02:15:19,178 --> 02:15:21,178
Bring it here.

2154
02:15:22,178 --> 02:15:25,178
I can't see.

2155
02:15:25,178 --> 02:15:26,178
It's amazing.

2156
02:15:26,178 --> 02:15:30,178
I'm so hungry. Can you see?

2157
02:15:32,178 --> 02:15:34,178
How do you feel?

2158
02:15:34,178 --> 02:15:36,178
Are you frustrated?

2159
02:15:38,178 --> 02:15:40,178
It feels good.

2160
02:15:40,178 --> 02:15:44,178
I might go to Aika's husband's house.

2161
02:15:44,178 --> 02:15:46,178
No, no, no.

2162
02:15:46,178 --> 02:15:48,178
It feels good.

2163
02:15:48,178 --> 02:15:50,178
It's amazing.

2164
02:15:50,178 --> 02:15:52,178
It's amazing.

2165
02:15:52,178 --> 02:15:54,178
I'm so happy.

2166
02:15:54,178 --> 02:15:56,178
I'm going to go.

2167
02:16:01,178 --> 02:16:03,178
It's amazing.

2168
02:16:03,178 --> 02:16:05,178
It's a baby.

2169
02:16:05,178 --> 02:16:06,178
It's amazing.

2170
02:16:06,178 --> 02:16:08,178
It's amazing.

2171
02:16:12,178 --> 02:16:14,178
How do you feel?

2172
02:16:14,178 --> 02:16:16,178
Do you feel the same as me?

2173
02:16:16,178 --> 02:16:18,178
It's amazing.

2174
02:16:18,178 --> 02:16:20,178
It's amazing.

2175
02:16:20,178 --> 02:16:22,178
You're so funny.

2176
02:16:22,178 --> 02:16:24,178
You're so funny.

2177
02:16:28,178 --> 02:16:30,178
It's amazing.

2178
02:16:33,178 --> 02:16:36,178
My microphone feels good.

2179
02:16:38,178 --> 02:16:40,178
I'm glad.

2180
02:16:41,178 --> 02:16:44,178
It feels better than your microphone.

2181
02:16:44,178 --> 02:16:47,178
My microphone feels good, too.

2182
02:16:51,178 --> 02:16:53,178
Don't move.

2183
02:16:53,178 --> 02:16:55,178
Don't move.

2184
02:16:55,178 --> 02:16:57,178
It feels good.

2185
02:16:58,178 --> 02:17:00,326
No, no, no.

2186
02:17:04,410 --> 02:17:06,410
I'm going.

2187
02:17:06,410 --> 02:17:08,410
I'm going.

2188
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:10,962
I'm going.

2189
02:17:10,962 --> 02:17:12,962
I'm going.

2190
02:17:12,962 --> 02:17:14,962
I can't stop.

2191
02:17:14,962 --> 02:17:16,962
I can't stop.

2192
02:17:16,962 --> 02:17:18,962
Look at this.

2193
02:17:18,962 --> 02:17:20,962
She is having sex with a man.

2194
02:17:20,962 --> 02:17:22,962
She is a psychopath.

2195
02:17:22,962 --> 02:17:24,962
She is a psychopath.

2196
02:17:24,962 --> 02:17:26,962
I'm so happy.

2197
02:17:26,962 --> 02:17:28,962
I'm so happy.

2198
02:17:28,962 --> 02:17:30,962
I'm so happy.

2199
02:17:30,962 --> 02:17:32,962
I'm so happy.

2200
02:17:32,962 --> 02:17:34,962
Look at this.

2201
02:17:34,962 --> 02:17:36,962
Look at this.

2202
02:17:36,962 --> 02:17:38,962
Isn't it incredible?

2203
02:17:38,962 --> 02:17:40,962
Isn't it incredible?

2204
02:17:40,962 --> 02:17:42,962
She was so surprised to see me.

2205
02:17:42,962 --> 02:17:44,962
I didn't expect that.

2206
02:17:44,962 --> 02:17:46,962
I didn't expect that.

2207
02:17:46,962 --> 02:17:48,962
That's true.

2208
02:17:48,962 --> 02:17:50,962
That's true.

2209
02:17:50,962 --> 02:17:52,962
She is so comfortable.

2210
02:17:52,962 --> 02:17:54,962
You are excited to see my face.

2211
02:17:54,962 --> 02:17:56,962
You are excited to see my face.

2212
02:17:57,962 --> 02:17:59,962
That's true.

2213
02:17:59,962 --> 02:18:01,962
I hate Aika.

2214
02:18:19,102 --> 02:18:21,102
I'm wet.

2215
02:18:25,102 --> 02:18:28,102
Are you going to make me wet again?

2216
02:18:28,102 --> 02:18:30,102
I'm sorry.

2217
02:18:34,102 --> 02:18:36,102
It's the best.

2218
02:18:36,102 --> 02:18:38,102
It feels good.

2219
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:52,110
I'm annoyed.

2220
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:55,110
It's really annoying.

2221
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:58,110
I can't stand it.

2222
02:18:58,110 --> 02:19:00,110
I can't stand it.

2223
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:01,110
I'm sorry.

2224
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:03,110
I can't stand it.

2225
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:09,110
I can't stand it.

2226
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:11,110
I'll give you a lot.

2227
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:13,110
Give me a lot.

2228
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:15,110
It hurts.

2229
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:21,110
Look at this.

2230
02:19:22,110 --> 02:19:24,110
It's a lot.

2231
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:29,110
There's a lot of it.

2232
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:35,110
I'm so happy.

2233
02:19:38,110 --> 02:19:40,110
Did you see it?

2234
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:42,110
Did you see it?

2235
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:45,110
Did you wait for me?

2236
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:51,110
I'm getting more and more white.

2237
02:19:54,110 --> 02:19:56,110
Look at this.

2238
02:20:02,110 --> 02:20:04,110
It feels good.

2239
02:20:08,110 --> 02:20:11,110
I didn't know it was this much.

2240
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:13,110
I didn't know.

2241
02:20:16,110 --> 02:20:19,110
What are you doing?

2242
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:23,110
It's the best.

2243
02:20:24,110 --> 02:20:26,110
I'm so happy.

2244
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:30,110
You like a bitch, don't you?

2245
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:33,110
It's the best.

2246
02:20:33,110 --> 02:20:35,110
It's the best.

2247
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:39,110
I'm so happy.

2248
02:20:40,110 --> 02:20:42,110
I'm so happy.

2249
02:20:42,110 --> 02:20:44,110
It feels good.

2250
02:20:44,110 --> 02:20:46,110
It feels good.

2251
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:48,110
I can't stand it.

2252
02:22:21,774 --> 02:22:23,774
Don't wake me up.

2253
02:22:24,774 --> 02:22:26,774
You are a pervert.

2254
02:22:27,774 --> 02:22:30,774
You lick my bun.

2255
02:22:31,774 --> 02:22:34,774
It's easy for you.

2256
02:22:45,774 --> 02:22:47,774
I can't be with you.

2257
02:22:47,774 --> 02:22:49,774
Which one do you like?

2258
02:22:50,774 --> 02:22:52,774
Which one do you like?

2259
02:23:01,542 --> 02:23:06,214
You can't be without me.

2260
02:23:15,574 --> 02:23:18,574
Let me taste you.

2261
02:23:23,574 --> 02:23:25,574
You are dirty.

2262
02:23:27,574 --> 02:23:29,574
You are dirty.

2263
02:23:30,574 --> 02:23:32,574
I'll clean you up.

2264
02:23:33,574 --> 02:23:35,574
I'll clean you up.

2265
02:23:42,574 --> 02:23:44,574
Why are you so soft?

2266
02:23:54,574 --> 02:23:58,574
Let me in.

2267
02:23:58,574 --> 02:24:00,574
Let me in.

2268
02:24:01,574 --> 02:24:04,574
Why don't you let me in?

2269
02:24:05,574 --> 02:24:07,574
Don't you like it?

2270
02:24:07,574 --> 02:24:09,574
Don't you like it?

2271
02:24:09,574 --> 02:24:11,574
Tell me to let you in.

2272
02:24:12,574 --> 02:24:14,574
Tell me that you want me.

2273
02:24:15,574 --> 02:24:17,574
Can't you say it?

2274
02:24:17,574 --> 02:24:19,574
I want you.

2275
02:24:19,574 --> 02:24:21,574
One more time.

2276
02:24:21,574 --> 02:24:23,574
You want me.

2277
02:24:41,574 --> 02:24:43,574
Do you want me?

2278
02:24:46,574 --> 02:24:48,574
Come here.

2279
02:24:52,806 --> 02:24:54,806
It feels good.

2280
02:24:54,806 --> 02:24:56,806
It feels good just to be in here.

2281
02:24:59,806 --> 02:25:01,806
You are so soft.

2282
02:25:01,806 --> 02:25:03,806
I knew it.

2283
02:25:08,806 --> 02:25:10,806
You are so soft.

2284
02:25:10,806 --> 02:25:12,806
Let's take a picture.

2285
02:25:12,806 --> 02:25:14,806
Let's take a picture.

2286
02:25:14,806 --> 02:25:16,806
Let's take a picture.

2287
02:25:22,806 --> 02:25:24,806
It feels good.

2288
02:25:32,806 --> 02:25:34,806
I'm so good.

2289
02:25:38,806 --> 02:25:40,806
It feels good.

2290
02:25:42,806 --> 02:25:44,806
It feels good just to be here.

2291
02:25:45,806 --> 02:25:47,806
What should I do?

2292
02:26:07,874 --> 02:26:11,474
Nnnnnnnnnn...

2293
02:26:12,474 --> 02:26:13,474
Good...

2294
02:26:13,474 --> 02:26:14,474
Good...

2295
02:26:18,474 --> 02:26:21,474
Why am I already resting?

2296
02:26:21,474 --> 02:26:24,474
What a waste...

2297
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:10,630
Oh my god!

2298
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:12,630
It's like a blue sky.

2299
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:14,630
Oh my god!

2300
02:27:14,630 --> 02:27:16,630
Oh my god!

2301
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:18,630
I'm so sleepy.

2302
02:27:18,630 --> 02:27:20,630
You're still sleepy?

2303
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:22,630
What's wrong?

2304
02:27:22,630 --> 02:27:24,630
I'm going to sleep.

2305
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:28,630
Oh no!

2306
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:36,630
It feels so good.

2307
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:38,630
I'm so sleepy.

2308
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:40,630
I'm glad you can use the phrase

2309
02:27:40,630 --> 02:27:42,630
that you used with Kanae.

2310
02:27:51,162 --> 02:27:58,162
Let me go! Let me go!

2311
02:28:23,274 --> 02:28:25,274
You have a lot of hair!

2312
02:28:25,274 --> 02:28:28,274
I'll squeeze it for you.

2313
02:28:30,274 --> 02:28:33,274
But you can't take it off, can you?

2314
02:28:33,274 --> 02:28:35,274
I want you to take it off.

2315
02:28:35,274 --> 02:28:37,274
Please.

2316
02:28:40,274 --> 02:28:42,274
Please!

2317
02:28:42,274 --> 02:28:43,274
Please!

2318
02:28:43,274 --> 02:28:45,274
Oh, my God!

2319
02:28:45,274 --> 02:28:47,274
I'll take it off.

2320
02:28:47,274 --> 02:28:49,274
Please!

2321
02:28:50,274 --> 02:28:51,274
I'm happy.

2322
02:28:51,274 --> 02:28:53,274
Look at this.

2323
02:28:58,274 --> 02:29:00,274
You have a lot of hair.

2324
02:29:01,274 --> 02:29:03,274
You just took it off.

2325
02:29:12,274 --> 02:29:15,274
Look at this.

2326
02:29:15,274 --> 02:29:17,274
It stinks.

2327
02:29:17,274 --> 02:29:19,274
What? It stinks?

2328
02:29:19,274 --> 02:29:21,274
Don't say that.

2329
02:29:21,274 --> 02:29:23,274
It stinks.

2330
02:29:23,274 --> 02:29:26,274
Are you still in a bad mood?

2331
02:29:26,274 --> 02:29:28,274
I feel good.

2332
02:29:28,274 --> 02:29:31,274
You look embarrassed.

2333
02:29:31,274 --> 02:29:34,274
Aren't you embarrassed to be looked at like this?

2334
02:29:35,274 --> 02:29:37,274
I'm happy.

2335
02:29:38,274 --> 02:29:40,274
I'll take it off, too.

2336
02:29:41,274 --> 02:29:43,274
I'll take it off again.

2337
02:29:43,274 --> 02:29:46,274
It's flying.

2338
02:29:48,274 --> 02:29:50,274
It's so funny.

2339
02:29:54,274 --> 02:29:59,746
I'm full of hair.

2340
02:30:01,746 --> 02:30:03,746
How many times did you take it off?

2341
02:30:03,746 --> 02:30:05,746
I know.

2342
02:30:05,746 --> 02:30:07,746
Why are you still in a bad mood?

2343
02:30:07,746 --> 02:30:09,746
You're so funny.

2344
02:30:15,746 --> 02:30:18,746
I can't take it off yet.

2345
02:30:20,746 --> 02:30:24,746
You're still in a bad mood, aren't you?

2346
02:30:24,746 --> 02:30:26,746
I can't take it off.

2347
02:30:26,746 --> 02:30:28,746
I can't take it off.

2348
02:30:28,746 --> 02:30:30,746
I can't take it off.

2349
02:30:30,746 --> 02:30:32,746
Oh, my God!

2350
02:30:35,746 --> 02:30:37,746
Oh, my God!

2351
02:30:38,746 --> 02:30:45,706
I can't believe I can love you.

2352
02:30:51,706 --> 02:30:53,706
I feel good.

2353
02:30:55,706 --> 02:30:58,706
I'm a woman of this kind.

2354
02:30:59,706 --> 02:31:01,706
Can you give it to me?

2355
02:31:03,706 --> 02:31:05,706
I can't.

2356
02:31:08,706 --> 02:31:10,706
I can't.

2357
02:31:10,706 --> 02:31:12,706
Help me.

2358
02:31:12,706 --> 02:31:15,906
Give it to me.

2359
02:31:15,906 --> 02:31:17,906
I'll give it to you.

2360
02:31:21,906 --> 02:31:23,906
I can't.

2361
02:31:31,906 --> 02:31:33,906
I feel good.

2362
02:31:44,906 --> 02:31:46,906
I'm a woman of this kind.

2363
02:31:48,946 --> 02:31:50,946
Help me.

2364
02:31:51,946 --> 02:31:53,946
I can't.

2365
02:32:10,778 --> 02:32:13,778
I'm really taking it off.

2366
02:32:13,778 --> 02:32:15,778
You're a pervert.

2367
02:32:15,778 --> 02:32:17,778
I can't.

2368
02:32:17,778 --> 02:32:19,778
Stop it.

2369
02:32:20,778 --> 02:32:23,778
I can't take it off.

2370
02:32:25,778 --> 02:32:27,778
It's bitter.

2371
02:32:27,778 --> 02:32:29,778
I can't take it off.

2372
02:32:30,778 --> 02:32:33,778
My boyfriend is a pervert.

2373
02:32:43,778 --> 02:32:45,778
I can't.

2374
02:32:45,778 --> 02:32:50,778
There are a lot of things in me.

2375
02:33:24,354 --> 02:33:29,354
You are such a bitch.

2376
02:33:29,354 --> 02:33:34,354
You are a psychopath.

2377
02:33:34,354 --> 02:33:39,354
But you are with me.

2378
02:33:39,354 --> 02:33:44,586
So, please look forward to the next one.

2379
02:33:44,586 --> 02:33:49,586
What?

2380
02:33:49,586 --> 02:33:54,586
I will prepare a lot of them.

2381
02:33:54,586 --> 02:33:59,586
What are you talking about?
